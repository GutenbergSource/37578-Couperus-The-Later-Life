<p class="first"><i>The Later Life</i> is the second of <i>The Books of
the Small Souls</i>, following immediately upon <i>Small Souls</i>, the
novel that gives the title to the series. In the present story,
Couperus reverts, at times and in a measure, to that earlier,
&ldquo;sensitivist&rdquo; method which he abandoned almost wholly in
<i>Small Souls</i> and which he again abandons in <i>The Twilight of
the Souls</i> and in <i>Dr. Adriaan</i>, the third and fourth novels of
the series.</p>

<p class="first">Van der Welcke woke that morning from a long, sound
sleep and stretched himself luxuriously in the warmth of the sheets.
But suddenly he remembered what he had been dreaming; and, as he did
so, he gazed into the wardrobe-glass, in which he could just see
himself from his pillow. A smile began to flicker about his curly
moustache; his blue eyes lit up with merriment. The sheets, which still
covered his body&mdash;he had flung his arms above his head&mdash;rose
and fell with the ripple of his silent chuckles; and suddenly,
irrepressibly, he burst into a loud guffaw:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Addie!&rdquo; he shouted, roaring with laughter.
&ldquo;Addie, are you up?&hellip; Addie, come here for a
minute!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The door between the two rooms opened; Addie entered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Addie!&hellip; Just imagine &hellip; just imagine what
I&rsquo;ve been dreaming. It was at the seaside&mdash;Ostende or
Scheveningen or somewhere&mdash;and everybody, everybody was going
about &hellip; half-naked &hellip; their legs bare&#8202;&hellip; and
the rest beautifully dressed. The men had coloured shirts and light
jackets and exquisite ties and straw hats, gloves and a stick in their
hands &hellip; and the rest &hellip; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb2"
href="#pb2" name="pb2">2</a>]</span>the rest was stark naked. The
ladies wore lovely blouses, magnificent hats, parasols &hellip; and
that was all!&hellip; And there was nothing in it, Addie, really there
was nothing in it; it was all quite natural, quite proper, quite
fashionable; and they walked about like that and sat on chairs and
listened to the music!&hellip; And the fishermen &hellip; the
fishermen, Addie, went about like that too!&hellip; And the musicians
&hellip; in the bandstand &hellip; were half-naked too; and &hellip;
the tails &hellip; of their dress-coats &hellip; hung down &hellip;
well &hellip; like that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Van der Welcke, as he told his dream in broken sentences, lay
shaking with laughter; his whole bed shook, the sheets rose and fell;
he was red in the face, as if on the verge of choking; he wept as
though consumed with grief; he gasped for breath, threw the bed-clothes
off:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just imagine it &hellip; just imagine it &hellip; you never
&hellip; you never saw such a stretch of sands as that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Addie had begun by listening with his usual serious face; but, when
he saw his father crying and gasping for breath, rolling about in the
bed, and when the vision of those sands became clearer to his
imagination, he also was seized with irresistible laughter. But he had
one peculiarity, that he could not laugh outright, but, shaken with
internal merriment, would laugh in his stomach without uttering a
sound; and he now sat on the edge of his <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb3" href="#pb3" name="pb3">3</a>]</span>father&rsquo;s bed, rocking
with silent laughter as the bed rocked under him. He tried not to look
at his father, for, when he saw his father&rsquo;s face, distorted and
purple with his paroxysms of laughter, lying on the white pillow like
the mask of some faun, he had to make agonized clutches at his stomach
and, bent double, to try to laugh outright; and he couldn&rsquo;t, he
couldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t it &hellip; doesn&rsquo;t it &hellip; strike
you as funny?&rdquo; asked Van der Welcke, hearing no sound of laughter
from his son.</p>
<p>And he looked at Addie and, suddenly remembering that Addie could
never roar with laughter out loud, he became still merrier at the sight
of his poor boy&rsquo;s silent throes, his noiseless stomach-laugh,
until his own laughter rang through the room, echoing back from the
walls, filling the whole room with loud Homeric mirth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Father, stop!&rdquo; said Addie at last, a little
relieved by his internal paroxysms, the tears streaming in wet streaks
down his face.</p>
<p>And he heaved a sigh of despair that he could not laugh like his
father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me a pencil and paper,&rdquo; said Van der Welcke,
&ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll draw you my dream.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Addie was very severe and shocked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Father, that won&rsquo;t do! That&rsquo;ll never
do&#8202;&hellip;. it&rsquo;d be a vulgar drawing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And his son&rsquo;s chaste seriousness worked to such <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb4" href="#pb4" name="pb4">4</a>]</span>an extent
upon Van der Welcke&rsquo;s easily tickled nerves that he began roaring
once more at Addie&rsquo;s indignation&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>Truitje was prowling about the passage, knocking at all the doors,
not knowing where Addie was:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you up, Master Addie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; cried Addie. &ldquo;Wait a minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went to the door:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A telegram &hellip; from the mistress, I
expect&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took the telegram, shut the door again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From Mamma?&rdquo; asked Van der Welcke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure to be. Yes, from Paris: <i lang=
"fr">&lsquo;J&rsquo;arrive ce soir.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>Van der Welcke grew serious:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And high time too. What business had Mamma to go rushing
abroad like that?&hellip; One&rsquo;d think we were well
off&#8202;&hellip;. What did you do about those bills,
Addie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I went to the shops and said that mevrouw was out of town and
that they&rsquo;d have to wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see. That&rsquo;s all right&#8202;&hellip;. Can you meet
Mamma at the station?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. The train&rsquo;s due at six&#8202;&hellip;. Then
we&rsquo;ll have dinner afterwards, with Mamma.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&#8202;&hellip;. I think I&rsquo;d better
dine at the club.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb5" href="#pb5"
name="pb5">5</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, Father, don&rsquo;t be silly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Van der Welcke, crossly, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t
bother me. I&rsquo;ll stay on at the Witte.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But don&rsquo;t you see that means starting off with a
manifestation? Whereas, if you wait in for Mamma peacefully and we all
have dinner together, then things&rsquo;ll come right of themselves.
That&rsquo;ll be much easier than if you go staying out at once: Mamma
would only think it rude.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rude?&hellip; Rude?&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s nothing to flare up about! And you just
come home to dinner. Then you&rsquo;ll be on the right side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll think it over. If I don&rsquo;t look out,
you&rsquo;ll be bossing me altogether.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, don&rsquo;t mind me, stay at the
Witte.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oho! So you&rsquo;re offended, young man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no! I&rsquo;d rather you came home, of course; but, if
you prefer to dine at the Witte, do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dearly-beloved son!&rdquo; said Van der Welcke, throwing out
his hands with a comical gesture of resignation. &ldquo;Your father
will obey your sapient wishes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fond Father, I thank you. But I must be off to school
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye, then &hellip; and you&rsquo;d better forget those
sands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They both exploded and Addie hurried away and vanished, shaking with
his painful stomach-laugh, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb6" href=
"#pb6" name="pb6">6</a>]</span>while he heard Van der Welcke break into
a fresh guffaw:</p>
<p>&ldquo;He <i>can</i> laugh!&rdquo; thought the boy. <span class=

<h2 class="main">Chapter II</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Van der Welcke had dressed and breakfasted and,
because he felt bored, took his bicycle and went for a long ride by
himself. He was very often bored these days, now that Addie was working
hard at the grammar-school. Without his boy, he seemed at once to have
nothing to do, no object in life; he could see no reason for his
existence. He would smoke endless cigarettes in his den, or go
bicycling, or turn up once in a way at the Plaats, once in a way at the
Witte; but he did not go to either of his clubs as often as he used to.
He saw much less of his friends, his friends of former days, the men of
birth and position who had all won fame in their respective spheres,
though Van Vreeswijck continued his visits regularly, appreciating the
cosy little dinners. Van der Welcke generally felt lonely and stranded,
found his own company more and more boring from day to day; and it was
only when he saw his boy come back from school that he cheered up,
enjoyed life, was glad and lively as a child.</p>
<p>He loved the quick movement of it; and he cycled and cycled along
the lonely, chill, windy country-roads, aiming at no destination, just
pedalling away for the sake of speed, for the sake of covering the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb8" href="#pb8" name=
"pb8">8</a>]</span>ground. If he were only rich: then he&rsquo;d have a
motor-car! There was nothing like a motor-car! A motor-car made up for
this rotten, stodgy, boring life. To rush along the smooth roads in
your car, to let her rip: tock, tock, tock, tock, tock-tock-tock-tock!
Ha!&hellip; Ha!&hellip; That would be grand! Suppose his father were to
make him a present of a car&#8202;&hellip;. Ha!&hellip;
Tock-tock-tock-tock!&hellip; And, as he spurted along, he suggested to
himself the frantic orgy of speed of a puffing, snorting motor-car, the
acrid stench of its petrol-fumes, the ready obedience of the
pneumatic-tyred wheels while the car flew through the dust like a
storm-chariot over the clouds. It made him
poetic&mdash;tock-tock-tock-tock, tock-tock-tock-tock&mdash;but, as
long as his father lived, he would never have enough money to buy
himself a decent car!</p>
<p>Life was stodgy, rotten, boring&#8202;&hellip;. If only Addie had
finished school! But then &hellip; then he would have to go to the
university &hellip; and into the diplomatic service&#8202;&hellip;. No,
no, the older his boy grew, the less he would see of
him&#8202;&hellip;. How wretched it all was: he did not know whether to
wish that Addie was older or not!&hellip; To think, it wasn&rsquo;t a
year ago since the child used to sit on his knee, with his cheek
against his father&rsquo;s, his arm round his father&rsquo;s neck; and
Van der Welcke would feel that slight and yet sturdy frame against his
heart; and now &hellip; now already he was a lad, a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb9" href="#pb9" name="pb9">9</a>]</span>chap with a
deep voice, who ruled his father with a rod of iron! Yes, Van der
Welcke was simply ruled by him: there was no getting away from it!
Suppose he wanted to stay and dine at the Witte that night: why the
blazes shouldn&rsquo;t he? And he knew as sure as anything that he
wouldn&rsquo;t! He would come home like a good little boy, because
Addie had rather he did, because otherwise Addie would look upon it as
a manifestation against Constance&#8202;&hellip;. She too was coming
back, after Addie had written that it really wouldn&rsquo;t do,
financially. She had run away like a madwoman, two months ago, after
that pleasant business at the last Sunday-evening which they had spent
at Mamma van Lowe&rsquo;s, after the furious scene which she had made
him, Van der Welcke, because he wanted to hit their brother-in-law, Van
Naghel, in the face. Mind, it was for her, for his wife&rsquo;s sake,
that he wanted to hit Van Naghel in the face. For her sake, because
that pompous ass had dared to say that he wasn&rsquo;t keen on
Constance calling on Bertha&rsquo;s at-home day &hellip; but that in
other respects they were brothers and sisters! The disgusting snob!
That old woman, that non-entity, that rotter, that twopenny-halfpenny
cabinet-minister, who had got on simply because old Van Lowe, in his
day, had kicked him upstairs step by step!&hellip; Van der Welcke was
still furious when he thought of the fellow, with his smooth face and
his namby-pamby speeches. He hadn&rsquo;t been able to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb10" href="#pb10" name="pb10">10</a>]</span>control
himself that time: his wife, at any rate, was his wife; his wife was
Baroness van der Welcke; and he couldn&rsquo;t stand it, that they
should insult his wife and before his face too; and, if Paul had not
prevented him, he would have struck the snobbish ass in the face,
thrashed him, thrashed him, thrashed him! His blood still boiled at the
thought of it&#8202;&hellip;. Well, there it was! Paul had held him
back &hellip; but still, he would have liked to challenge the fellow,
to have fought a duel with him!&hellip; He grinned&mdash;pedalling like
mad, bending over like a record-breaker at the last lap of a
bicycle-race&mdash;he grinned now when he thought of the despair of the
whole family, because their revered brother-in-law Van Naghel,
&ldquo;his excellency,&rdquo; whom they all looked up to with such
reverence, might have to fight a duel with a brother-in-law who was
already viewed with sufficient disfavour at the Hague!&hellip; Well, it
hadn&rsquo;t come off. They had all interfered; but it wasn&rsquo;t for
that reason, but because dear old Mamma van Lowe had taken to her
bed&mdash;and also for Addie&rsquo;s sake&mdash;that he had not
insisted on the duel. Yes, those Dutchmen: they never wanted to fight
if they could help it! He, Van der Welcke, would have liked to fight,
though Van Naghel had been a thousand times his brother-in-law, a
thousand times colonial secretary. And it wasn&rsquo;t only that the
whole family had thought the very idea of a duel so dreadful; but his
wise son had interfered, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb11" href=
"#pb11" name="pb11">11</a>]</span>had taken up a very severe attitude
to his father, had reproached him because he&mdash;still &ldquo;a young
man,&rdquo; as Addie put it in his amusing way&mdash;wanted to insult
and strike a man of Uncle van Naghel&rsquo;s age, even though it was
for Mamma&rsquo;s sake! And Addie had gone to Frans van Naghel, the
eldest son, the undergraduate, of whom he was very fond; and Frans was
furious, wanted to take his father&rsquo;s place and fight in his
stead. But Addie had said that Papa was in the wrong, that Papa had
lost his self-control; and he had calmed Frans and told him, his
father, positively, that it was his, Van der Welcke&rsquo;s, duty to
apologize to Uncle van Naghel! That boy, that boy, thought Van der
Welcke, thinking half-angrily of his son&rsquo;s perpetual tutelage. It
was really too silly: if he didn&rsquo;t look out, the brat would twist
him round his little finger entirely. A little chap like that, a
schoolboy of fourteen &hellip; and yet the beggar had managed so that
Frans did not challenge Van der Welcke and that Van der Welcke had sent
Van Naghel a note of apology, a note the thought of which made him boil
even now, made him rant and curse at the thought that he had let
himself be persuaded by the fourteen-year-old schoolboy. And then he
had had to express his regret to Mamma van Lowe into the bargain; but
that he didn&rsquo;t mind, for she was an old dear and he thought it
too bad that the wretched affair should have made her ill. And so the
fourteen-year-old schoolboy <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb12" href=
"#pb12" name="pb12">12</a>]</span>had succeeded in hushing up a Hague
scandal, just like a grown-up man&#8202;&hellip;. When you came to
think of it, it was simply absurd, incredible; you would never have
believed it if you read it in a book; and it was the positive truth:
the schoolboy had prevented the cabinet-minister or his son from
fighting a duel with the schoolboy&rsquo;s father!&hellip; And now Van
der Welcke had to choke with laughter at the thought of it; and, as he
spurted along the roads, like a professional, with his back bent into
an arch, he roared with laughter all by himself and thought:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord, what an extraordinary beggar he is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the boy&rsquo;s mother, after scene upon scene with him, the
father; his mother, furious that her husband should have dared to raise
his hand against that revered brother-in-law, &ldquo;his
excellency;&rdquo; his mother, driven out of her senses, with every
nerve on edge after all that she had had to endure that Sunday: his
mother the boy had not been able to restrain; a woman is always more
difficult to manage than a man; a mother is not half so easy as a
father! Constance, after one of those scenes which followed one upon
the other as long as the atmosphere remained charged with electricity,
had said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sick of it all; I&rsquo;m going away; I&rsquo;m
going abroad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And even the fact that she was leaving her son behind her did not
bring her to reason. She packed her trunks, told Truitje to keep house
for the master <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb13" href="#pb13" name=
"pb13">13</a>]</span>and Master Addie as she herself used to and went
away, almost insolently, hardly even saying good-bye to
Addie&#8202;&hellip;. They thought at first that she would do something
rash, goodness knows what, and were anxious because they didn&rsquo;t
know where Constance had gone; but the next day there was a telegram
from Paris to reassure them, telling them that Constance was going to
Nice and meant to stay some time. Then letters came from Nice and they
had no more fears, nor had Mamma van Lowe; they all thought the change
might even do her good; and she continued pretty sensible. She wrote to
her mother, to Addie; she wrote to Truitje, impressing upon her to look
after the house well and after the master and Master Addie and to see
that everything was going on all right when her mistress returned. And
this sensible, housewifely letter had done more than anything to
reassure Mamma van Lowe and the two of them; and now they didn&rsquo;t
grudge Constance, Mamma, her trip, for once in a way. But it was an
expensive amusement. Constance, it was true, had taken some money of
her own with her; but still, since they had come to the Hague, Van der
Welcke no longer made anything out of wine- and insurance-commissions;
he was no longer an agent for the Brussels firms; and they had not much
to live on and had to be very economical. And so Van der Welcke, after
seven weeks had passed, was obliged to tell Addie that it
wouldn&rsquo;t <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb14" href="#pb14" name=
"pb14">14</a>]</span>do for Mamma to stay on at Nice, in an expensive
hotel, and that he had better write to her. And the schoolboy had
written asking his mother to come back now, telling his mother that
that would have to do and that there was no money left. And Constance
was coming home that evening.</p>
<p>Van der Welcke was in good spirits all day, perhaps through the
after-effects of his dream&mdash;he kept seeing those sands before his
eyes&mdash;and, pedalling along like mad, he sat shaking in his saddle,
thinking of that young scamp of his, who ruled over his father and
mother. It wasn&rsquo;t right, it was too absurd, soon they would
neither of them be able to call their souls their own; but the boy was
so sensible and he was always the little peacemaker, who settled
everything. Yes, the scamp was the joy of his life; and really, really,
except for the boy, everything was unrelieved gloom&#8202;&hellip;. If
only he could buy a motor-car, or at least a motor-cycle. He must find
out one day, just ask what a motor-cycle cost&#8202;&hellip;. But,
apart from that, what was there? Especially now that they
two&mdash;Constance in particular&mdash;had wanted at all costs to
&ldquo;rehabilitate&rdquo; themselves, as Constance called it, in Hague
society and now that they had failed utterly through that scene with
Van Naghel, things were stodgier than ever &hellip; with no one to come
and see them but Van Vreeswijck, with no outside interests whatever. It
was <i>his</i> fault, his fault, his wife kept reproaching <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb15" href="#pb15" name="pb15">15</a>]</span>him in
their scenes, almost with enjoyment, revelling in her revenge, because
he, not long ago, had reproached her that it was <i>her</i> fault, her
fault that they were buried away there, &ldquo;cursing their luck in
the Kerkhoflaan.&rdquo; And he was sorry too because of Marianne: she
used to come and dine once in a way; when Van Vreeswijck was coming,
Constance would ask either Paul or Marianne, to make four; and, now
that he had insulted her father, she wouldn&rsquo;t come again, they
were on unfriendly terms not only with the parents, but also with the
daughter &hellip; and with the sons, to the great regret of Addie, who
was very fond of Frans and Henri&#8202;&hellip;. His fault! His fault!
Perhaps it was his fault, but he couldn&rsquo;t always restrain
himself, control himself, master himself. Possibly, if he had stuck to
his career, he would have learnt to do it, after his training in
diplomatic reserve &hellip; or else he would always have remained an
indifferent diplomatist. That might have happened too; it was quite
possible!&hellip; Yes, he was sorry &hellip; because of Marianne. She
was a nice girl, so natural, so unaffected, in spite of her worldly
environment; and he liked her eyes, her voice. He was sorry &hellip;
because of Marianne; but it couldn&rsquo;t be helped: although he had
written to her father, she would not come to the house again, she would
never come again, he thought.</p>
<p>And he almost sighed, sadly, he did not know <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb16" href="#pb16" name="pb16">16</a>]</span>why, no
doubt because life would be still more stodgy without Marianne&rsquo;s
eyes and voice. But, after all, it was only once every four or five
weeks that she used to come and dine; so what did it really matter?
What did it matter? No, really nothing mattered; really, the whole
world was a sickening, stodgy business, rottenly
managed&#8202;&hellip;. Oh, if he could only have bought a motor! The
longing was so intense, so violent that he was almost tempted to ask
his father for one straight out. And now, while he spurted home after
his long ride, he hummed between his teeth, to the rhythm of the flying
wheels, a song which he suddenly made up for himself:</p>
<p>&ldquo;A motor-car&mdash;and a motor-car: Ottocar in a
motor-car&mdash;Ottocar in a motor-car!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And burning with his longing for the unattainable, he pedalled
away&mdash;Ottocar in a motor-car!&mdash;in a mad frenzy, delighting in
the sheer speed of his ride, which made people turn round and stare at
him, at his arched back and his piston-legs, like an
automaton&rsquo;s&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>He came home very late, just as Addie was starting to go to the
station.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really thought, Daddy, that you were staying at the Witte
after all!&rdquo; said the boy. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re so late!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, old chap, I wouldn&rsquo;t have dared do that!&rdquo;
cried Van der Welcke. &ldquo;Ottocar&mdash;in a motor-car! <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb17" href="#pb17" name=
"pb17">17</a>]</span>I&rsquo;ve been cycling my legs off and I&rsquo;m
tired out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re quite red in the face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ve had great fun! Ottocar&mdash;in his
motor-car! You see, I&rsquo;ve got to have my fun by myself &hellip;
when you&rsquo;re cooped up at school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you saying, Father, about Ottocar?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing, nothing, it&rsquo;s a song: Ottocar in his
motor-car!&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m off &hellip; to meet Mamma. Good-bye, you mad
old Dad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye, my boy&#8202;&hellip;. Come here a
moment&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter now?&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old chap, I feel so lonely sometimes &hellip; so terribly
alone &hellip; so forlorn&#8202;&hellip;. Tell me, Addie, you&rsquo;ll
always be your father&rsquo;s chum, won&rsquo;t you?&hellip; You
won&rsquo;t leave me, like all the rest? You&rsquo;ll stay with your
old father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Daddy, what makes you so sentimental
suddenly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, I&rsquo;m not sentimental &hellip; but, my dear boy,
I&rsquo;m so awfully bored sometimes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why don&rsquo;t you find more to do, Daddy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my boy, what would you have me do?&hellip; Oh, if I only
had a car!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A car?&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A motor-car! Like Ottocar!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Van der Welcke burst out laughing: <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb18" href="#pb18" name="pb18">18</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;He at least <i>had</i> one!&rdquo; he bellowed, amidst his
laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father, you&rsquo;re mad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, to-day &hellip; because of that dream, those wonderful
sands&#8202;&hellip;. Oh, how I wish I were Ottocar!&hellip; My boy, my
boy, I&rsquo;m so terribly bored sometimes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And just after you&rsquo;ve had a jolly
bicycle-ride!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All on my own &hellip; with my head full of all sorts of
wretched thoughts!&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, to-morrow, Wednesday afternoon, we&rsquo;ll go
together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean it? A long ride? To-morrow? To-morrow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, certainly, a long ride.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You brick! My own Addie! My boy! My boy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was as grateful as a child, caught his son in his arms:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Addie, let me give you one more hug!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, be quick about it, Father, for I must really go, or I
shall be late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Van der Welcke put his arms round him, kissed him on both cheeks,
and flew upstairs. He undressed, flung his clothes to right and left,
washed his face in a huge basin of water, shaved quickly, dressed
himself neatly. He did all this with much fuss and rushing about, as
though his toilet was a most important affair. Then he went downstairs.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb19" href="#pb19" name=
"pb19">19</a>]</span>The table was laid. It was nearly seven. Constance
would be there in no time. And, sitting down in the drawing-room with a
cigarette, looking round the room&mdash;Constance&rsquo; room all over,
in which he sat as a stranger&mdash;he hummed, while he waited for his
wife and his son:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Ottocar had a motor-car; but
I&mdash;have&mdash;<i>none</i>!&hellip;&rdquo; <span class=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Addie ran up the stairs to the platform just as the
train from Paris steamed in. He hurried along, looking into the
windows&#8202;&hellip;. There was Mamma, there was Mamma! And he flung
himself on the handle, pulled open the door, helped Constance to
alight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There you are! There you are at
last!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She laughed, kissed him, her handsome, sturdy boy:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My boy, how could I do so long without you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, so you see! You&rsquo;re surprised at it yourself! Come,
make haste, I&rsquo;ve got a cab. Give me your
luggage-ticket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He swept her along; and, in the cab, while they were waiting for the
luggage:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me, Addie,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;is there really no
money left?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you imagine that, when you go spending seven weeks at
Nice, in a first-class hotel, there&rsquo;ll still be money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never thought of it like that,&rdquo; she said meekly.</p>
<p>He laughed, thought her tremendously amusing. She laughed too, they
both bubbled with mirth, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb21" href=
"#pb21" name="pb21">21</a>]</span>Constance glad at seeing him, at
finding him looking so well and in such good spirits.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mamma, you&rsquo;re hopeless!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Did
you really never think that there was no money left?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Constance, humbly.</p>
<p>And they both started laughing again. He shook his head, considered
her incorrigible:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ve got some bills too, for the things you bought
when you went away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes!&rdquo; she said, remembering. &ldquo;But they can
wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told them that you were abroad and that they&rsquo;d have
to wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said she.</p>
<p>And they arrived in the Kerkhoflaan in excellent spirits.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Truitje, have you looked after the master and Master
Addie nicely?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did the best I could, ma&rsquo;am&#8202;&hellip;. But
it&rsquo;s just as well you&rsquo;re back
again&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Constance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Henri?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you have a good time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re looking well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks&#8202;&hellip;. Oh, have you waited dinner for
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, of course!&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb22"
href="#pb22" name="pb22">22</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go and wash my hands and I&rsquo;ll be down
immediately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mamma never thought for a moment &hellip; that there was no
money left,&rdquo; said Addie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; said Van der Welcke.</p>
<p>But he seemed to consider it quite natural; and, when Constance came
downstairs, he said, laughing:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you think that there was no money
left?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Constance glanced up, imagining that he meant to make a scene. But
he was smiling; and his question sounded good-humoured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; she said, as if it was only natural.</p>
<p>And now they all went into fits of laughter, Addie with his silent
convulsions, which made him shake up and down painfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do laugh right out, boy!&rdquo; said Van der Welcke, teasing
him. &ldquo;Do laugh right out, if you can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were very gay as they sat down to dinner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And just guess,&rdquo; said Constance, &ldquo;whom I met in
the hotel at Nice, whom I sat next to at the <i lang="fr">table
d&rsquo;h&ocirc;te</i>: the d&rsquo;Azignys, from Rome&#8202;&hellip;.
The first people I met, the d&rsquo;Azignys. It&rsquo;s incredible how
small the world is, how small, how small!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He also remembered the d&rsquo;Azignys: the French ambassador at
Rome and his wife &hellip; fifteen years ago now&#8202;&hellip;.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb23" href="#pb23" name=
"pb23">23</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; he asked, greatly interested. &ldquo;Were they
all right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, quite,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;quite! I remembered them
at once, but didn&rsquo;t bow. But d&rsquo;Azigny was very polite; and,
after a minute or two, he spoke to me, asked if he wasn&rsquo;t right
in thinking I was the Baronne de Staffelaer. &lsquo;Baronne van der
Welcke,&rsquo; I replied. He flushed up and his wife nudged him, but
after that they were very charming and amiable all the time I was at
Nice. I saw a lot of them and, through their introduction, I went to a
splendid ball at the Duc de Rivoli&rsquo;s. I enjoyed it thoroughly. I
wore a beautiful dress, I was in my element once more, I was a
foreigner, everybody was very pleasant and I felt light-hearted again,
quit of everything and everybody, and I thought to
myself&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what did you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, if only we had never gone back to Holland! If, when
Brussels became so dull, we had just moved to a town like Nice.
It&rsquo;s delightful there. As a foreigner, you need have nothing to
trouble about, you can do just as you like, know just whom you please.
You feel so free, so free&#8202;&hellip;. And why, I thought, must
Addie become and remain a Dutchman? He could just as well be a
Frenchman &hellip; or a cosmopolitan&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Mamma: I don&rsquo;t feel like being a Frenchman,
nor yet a cosmopolitan. And you&rsquo;d <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb24" href="#pb24" name="pb24">24</a>]</span>better not say that to
Uncle Gerrit, or you can look out for squalls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Addie, I&rsquo;ve met with so many squalls in my dear Holland
that I feel like blowing away myself, away from
everybody&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Including your son?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, my boy. I missed you. I thought of you every day. I
<i>am</i> so glad to see you again. But I did think to myself that we
should have done better never to come back to Holland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Van der Welcke, thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We could have lived at Nice, if we liked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Van der Welcke admitted, a little dubiously,
&ldquo;but you were longing for your family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She clenched her little hand and struck the table with it:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you long for
your parents, for your country?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But not so much as you did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who thought it necessary for Addie? I
didn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; she exclaimed, in a shrill voice. &ldquo;I
didn&rsquo;t for a moment! It was you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, d&mdash;&mdash;,&rdquo; said Addie, almost breaking into
an oath. &ldquo;My dearest parents, for Heaven&rsquo;s sake don&rsquo;t
begin quarrelling at once, for I assure the two of you that, if you do,
<i>I&rsquo;ll</i> blow away and <i>I&rsquo;ll</i> go to Nice &hellip;
money or no money!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Van der Welcke and Constance gave one roar and Addie joined in the
laugh. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb25" href="#pb25" name=
"pb25">25</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that boy!&rdquo; said Van der Welcke, choking with
merriment. &ldquo;That boy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Constance uttered a deep sigh:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Addie!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Mamma does and says such
strange things, sometimes &hellip; but she doesn&rsquo;t mean them a
bit. She&rsquo;s really glad to be back again, in her horrid country
&hellip; and in her own home, her dear cosy home &hellip; and with her
son, her darling boy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And, throwing her arm round his neck, she let her head fall on his
breast and she sobbed, sobbed aloud, so that Truitje, entering the
room, started, but then, accustomed to these perpetual, inevitable
scenes, quietly went on laying the dessert-plates.</p>
<p>Van der Welcke fiddled with his knife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t those two manage to get on better
together?&rdquo; thought Addie, sadly, while he comforted his mother
and gently patted her shoulder&#8202;&hellip;. <span class=

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;And shall Mamma show you what she looked like
at the Duc de Rivoli&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dinner was over and she was sitting by her open trunk, while Truitje
helped her unpack and put the things away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had my photograph taken at Nice. But first here&rsquo;s a
work-box for Truitje, with Nice violets on it. Look, Truitje:
it&rsquo;s palm-wood inlaid; a present for you. And here&rsquo;s one
for cook.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, thank you, ma&rsquo;am!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And for my wise son I hunted all over Nice for a souvenir and
found nothing, for I was afraid of bringing you something not serious
enough for your patriarchal tastes; and so I had myself photographed
for you. There: the last frivolous portrait of your mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She took the photograph from its envelope: it showed her at
full-length, standing, in her ball-dress; a photograph taken with a
great deal of artistry and <i>chic</i>, but too young, too much touched
up, with a little too much pose about the hair, the fan, the train.</p>
<p>He looked at her with a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what do you think of it?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a bundle of vanity you are, Mamma!&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb27" href="#pb27" name="pb27">27</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you like it? Then give it back at
once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, no, Mummy: I think it awfully jolly to have a photograph
of you&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of my last mad mood. Now your mother is really going to grow
old, my boy. Upon my word, I believe Truitje admires my portrait more
than my son does!&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, ma&rsquo;am, I think it&rsquo;s splendid!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many did you have done, Mummy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Six. One for Granny, one for Uncle Gerrit, one for Uncle
Paul, one for you, one for myself&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And one for Papa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Papa owns the original!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, give your husband one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Henri!&rdquo; she called.</p>
<p>He came in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a portrait of your wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lovely!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s awfully
good! Thanks very much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glad you like it. My husband and my handmaid are satisfied,
at any rate. My son thinks me a bundle of vanity&#8202;&hellip;. Oh,
how glad I am to be back!&hellip; Here&rsquo;s the ball-dress.
We&rsquo;ll put it away to-morrow. I shall never wear the thing again.
A dress that cost six hundred francs for one wearing. Now we&rsquo;ll
be old again and economical.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They all laughed, including Truitje.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, how glad I am to be back!&hellip; My own <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb28" href="#pb28" name="pb28">28</a>]</span>room, my
own cupboards&#8202;&hellip;. Truitje, what did you give your masters
to eat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, just what you used to, ma&rsquo;am!&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it was all right? I wasn&rsquo;t
missed?&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but you mustn&rsquo;t go away for so long again,
ma&rsquo;am!&rdquo; said Truitje, in alarm.</p>
<p>Constance laughed and stretched herself out on her sofa, glad to be
home. Van der Welcke left the room with his photograph, Truitje with
her work-box.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come here, Addie. Papa has had you for seven weeks. Now you
belong to me &hellip; for an indefinite period.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She drew him down beside her, took his hands. It struck him that she
looked tired, more like her years, not like her photograph; and, his
mind travelling swiftly to his father, he thought his father so young,
outwardly a young man and inwardly sometimes a child: Ottocar in a
motor-car&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s strange, Addie,&rdquo; she said, softly,
&ldquo;that you are only fourteen: you always seem to me at least
twenty. And I think it strange also that I should have such a big son.
So everything is strange. And your mother herself, my boy, is the
strangest of all. If you ask me honestly if I like being
&lsquo;vain,&rsquo; I mean, taking part in social frivolities, I
shouldn&rsquo;t know what to answer. I certainly used to enjoy it in
the old days; and, a fortnight ago, I admit I looked upon it as a sort
of youth that comes over <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb29" href=
"#pb29" name="pb29">29</a>]</span>one again; but really it all means
nothing: just a little brilliancy; and then you feel so tired and empty
&hellip; and so discontented&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stopped suddenly, not caring to say more, and looked at the
photograph, now lying on a table beside her. It made her laugh again;
and at the same time a tear trembled on her lashes. And she did not
know if it gave her a peaceful feeling to be growing old &hellip; or if
she regretted it. It was as though the sun of Nice had imbued her with
a strange, dull melancholy which she herself did not understand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To live!&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;I have never lived. I
would so gladly live once &hellip; just once. To live! But not like
this &hellip; in a dress that cost six hundred francs. I know that, I
know all about it: it is just a momentary brilliancy and then
nothing&#8202;&hellip;. To live! I should like to live &hellip; really
&hellip; truly. There must be <i>something</i>. But it is a mad wish. I
am too old. I am growing old, I am becoming an old
woman&#8202;&hellip;. To live! I have never lived &hellip; I have been
in the world, as a woman of the world; I spoilt <i>that</i> life; then
I hid myself&#8202;&hellip;. I was so anxious to come back to my
country and my family; and it all meant nothing but a little show and
illusion &hellip; and a great deal of disappointment. And so the days
were wasted, one after the other, and I &hellip; have &hellip; never
&hellip; lived&#8202;&hellip;. Just as I throw away my <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb30" href="#pb30" name="pb30">30</a>]</span>money,
so I have thrown away my days. Perhaps I have squandered all my days
&hellip; for nothing. Oh, I oughtn&rsquo;t to feel like this! What does
it mean when I do? What am I regretting? What is there left for me? At
Nice, I thought for a moment of joining in that feminine revolt against
approaching age; and I did join in it; and I succeeded. But what does
it all mean and what is the use of it? It only means shining a little
longer, for nothing; but it does not mean living&#8202;&hellip;. But to
long for it doesn&rsquo;t mean anything either, for there is nothing
for me now but to grow old, in my home; and, even if I am not exactly
among my people, my brothers and sisters, at any rate I have my mother
&hellip; and, perhaps for quite a long time still, my son
too&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mummy &hellip; what are you thinking about so
deeply?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But she smiled, said nothing, looked earnestly at him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s much fonder of his father,&rdquo; she thought.
&ldquo;I know it, but it can&rsquo;t be helped. I must put up with it
and accept what he gives me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, Mummy, what are you thinking about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lots of things, my boy &hellip; and perhaps
nothing&#8202;&hellip;. Mamma feels so lonely &hellip; with no one
about her &hellip; except you&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He started, struck by what she had said: it was almost the same
words that his father had used that afternoon. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb31" href="#pb31" name="pb31">31</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;My boy, will you always stay with me? You won&rsquo;t go
away, like everybody?&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, Mummy, you&rsquo;ve got Granny and Uncle Gerrit and
Uncle Paul.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, they are nice,&rdquo; she said, softly.</p>
<p>And she thought:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall lose him, later, when he&rsquo;s grown
up&#8202;&hellip;. I know that I shall lose
him&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It made her feel very weak and helpless; and she began to
cry&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>He knelt down beside her and, in a stern voice, forbade her to be so
excitable, forbade her to cry about nothing&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>It was heavenly to have him laying down the law like that. And she
thought:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall lose him, when he&rsquo;s grown up&#8202;&hellip;.
Oh, let me be thankful that I have him still!&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, tired out, she went to sleep; and he left her, thinking to
himself:</p>
<p>&ldquo;They both feel the same thing!&rdquo; <span class=

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">She tried tyrannically to monopolize her son, so that
Van der Welcke became very jealous. It was the next day, Wednesday
afternoon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you coming with me to Granny&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I promised Papa to go cycling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve had seven weeks for cycling with
Papa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I promised him yesterday that I would go for a long ride
to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was angry, offended:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first day that I&rsquo;m home!&hellip;&rdquo; she
began.</p>
<p>He kissed her, with a shower of tiny little kisses, tried to appease
her wrath:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I promised!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t go cycling
together often. You will have me to yourself all the evening. Be
sensible now and nice; and don&rsquo;t be so cross.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She tried to be reasonable, but it cost her an effort. She went
alone to Mrs. van Lowe&rsquo;s. She saw two umbrellas in the hall:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is with mevrouw?&rdquo; she asked the maid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. van Naghel and Mrs. van Saetzema.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She hesitated. She had not seen her sisters since that awful
Sunday-evening. She had gone abroad five days after. But she wanted to
show them&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>She went upstairs. Her step was no longer as <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb33" href="#pb33" name="pb33">33</a>]</span>timid as
when she climbed those stairs ten months ago, when she first came back
among them all. She did not wish to seem arrogant, but also she did not
wish to be too humble. She entered with a smile:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mamma!&rdquo; she cried, gaily, kissing her mother.</p>
<p>Mrs. van Lowe was surprised:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My child!&rdquo; she exclaimed, trembling. &ldquo;My child!
Are you back? Are you back again? What a long time you&rsquo;ve been
abroad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve enjoyed myself immensely. How d&rsquo;ye do,
Bertha? How d&rsquo;ye do, Adolphine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did not shake hands, but just nodded to them, almost cordially,
because of her mother, who looked anxiously at her three daughters.
Bertha and Adolphine nodded back. Carelessly and easily, she took the
lead in the conversation and talked about Nice. She tried to talk
naturally, without bragging; but in spite of herself there was a note
of triumph in her voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I felt I wanted to go abroad a bit&#8202;&hellip;. Not
nice of me to run away without saying good-bye, was it, Mamma dear?
Well, you see, Constance sometimes behaves differently from other
people&#8202;&hellip;. I had a very pleasant time at Nice: full season,
lovely weather.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Weren&rsquo;t you lonely?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, for on the very first day I met some of our Rome friends
at the hotel&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She felt that Bertha started, blinked her eyes, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb34" href="#pb34" name=
"pb34">34</a>]</span>disapproved of her for daring to speak of Rome.
And she revelled in doing so, casually and airily, thought it delicious
to dazzle Adolphine with a list of her social triumphs, very naturally
described:</p>
<p>&ldquo;People we used to know in Rome: Comte and Comtesse
d&rsquo;Azigny. He was French ambassador in those days. They recognized
me at once and were very kind; and through the introduction I went to a
glorious ball at the Duchesse de Rivoli&rsquo;s. And, Mummy,
here&rsquo;s a portrait of your daughter in her ball-dress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She showed the photograph, enjoyed giving the almost
too-well-executed portrait to Mamma, not to her sisters, while letting
them see it. She described her dress, described the ball, bragging a
little this time, saying that, after all, parties abroad were always
much grander than that &ldquo;seeing a few friends&rdquo; in Holland,
addressing all her remarks to Mamma and, in words just tinged with
ostentation, displaying no small scorn for Bertha&rsquo;s dinners and
Adolphine&rsquo;s &ldquo;little evenings:&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything here is on such a small scale,&rdquo; she
continued. &ldquo;There, the first thing you see is a suite of twelve
rooms, all with electric light &hellip; or, better still, all lit up
with wax-candles&#8202;&hellip;. Yes, our little social efforts at the
Hague cut a very poor figure beside it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She gave a contemptuous little laugh to annoy <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb35" href="#pb35" name="pb35">35</a>]</span>her
sisters, while Mamma, always interested in the doings of the great, did
not notice the contempt and was glad enough to see that the sisters
behaved as usual to one another. And now Constance went on to say that
everything had gone on so well at home, that Truitje had looked after
everything, even though Constance had gone away indefinitely, an
unprecedented thing, so unlike a Dutch housewife! Then she turned to
her sisters with an indifferent phrase or two; and they answered her
almost cordially, out of respect for Mamma&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>Adolphine was the first to leave, exasperated by Constance&rsquo;
insufferable tone, by all that talk about Nice, all those counts and
dukes whom Constance had mentioned; and, when Constance said good-bye,
Bertha also left and they went down the stairs together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Constance,&rdquo; said Bertha, &ldquo;can I speak to you a
minute in the cloak-room?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Constance looked up haughtily, surprised; but she did not like to
refuse. They went into the little cloak-room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Constance,&rdquo; said Bertha, &ldquo;I do so want to say
that I am sorry for what happened between us. Really, it pained me very
much. And I want to tell you also that Van Naghel greatly appreciated
Van der Welcke&rsquo;s writing to him to apologize. He has written to
Van der Welcke to say so. But we should both like to call on you one
day, to show <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb36" href="#pb36" name=
"pb36">36</a>]</span>you how glad we should be to come back to the old
terms once more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bertha,&rdquo; said Constance, a little impatiently and
wearily, &ldquo;I am prepared to receive your visit, but I should
really like to know what is the good of it and why you suggest it. Do
let us have some sincerity &hellip; when there is no occasion for
hypocrisy. Sometimes one has to be insincere &hellip; but there is no
need for that between us now. We both know that our mutual sympathy, if
it ever existed, is dead. We never meet except at Mamma&rsquo;s and we
don&rsquo;t let her see our estrangement. Apart from that, it seems to
me that things are over between us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you would rather that Van Naghel and I did not
come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not for me to decide, Bertha: I shall speak about
it to Van der Welcke and write you a line.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that cold answer all you have to say to me,
Constance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bertha, a little time ago, I was not backward in showing my
affection for you all. Perhaps I asked too much in return; but, in any
case, I was repulsed. And now I retire. That is all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Constance, you don&rsquo;t know how sorry we all are that the
old aunts &hellip; spoke as they did. They are foolish old women,
Constance; they are in their second childhood. Mamma had to take to
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb37" href="#pb37" name=
"pb37">37</a>]</span>her bed, her nerves are still quite upset; she
can&rsquo;t bear to see her sisters now; and it sometimes sends her
almost out of her mind. I have never seen her like it before. And we
are all of us, all of us, Constance, very, very sorry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bertha, those two old women only yelled out at the top of
their voices, as deaf people do, what the rest of you thought in your
hearts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, Constance, don&rsquo;t be so bitter. You are hard and
unjust. I swear that you are mistaken. It is not as you think. Let me
show it to you in the future, let me prove it to you &hellip; and
please speak to Van der Welcke and write and tell me a day when we
shall find you at home, so that Van Naghel can shake hands with Van der
Welcke. He is not a young man, Constance, and your husband is under
forty. It&rsquo;s true, Van der Welcke has apologized and Van Naghel
appreciates it, but that doesn&rsquo;t prevent him from wishing to
shake hands with Van der Welcke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell my husband, Bertha. But I don&rsquo;t know
that he will think it so necessary to shake hands, any more than I do.
We live very quietly now, Bertha, and people, Hague people, no longer
concern us. And Van Naghel only wants to shake hands because of
people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And because of the old friendship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, Bertha,&rdquo; said Constance, coldly,
&ldquo;because of the old friendship: a vague term that says
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb38" href="#pb38" name=
"pb38">38</a>]</span>very little to me. What I wished for was brotherly
and sisterly affection, cordial companionship. That is no longer
possible: it was a foolish fancy of mine, which has gone forever. But,
as I said, I shall speak to Van der Welcke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They came out into the hall; the maid was waiting at the door. It
was raining. Bertha&rsquo;s carriage was outside, had been sent to
fetch her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I drop you on my way, Constance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, thank you, Bertha; the fresh air will do me good;
I&rsquo;d rather walk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And, as she walked, she thought:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, why did I go on like that to annoy them? And why
didn&rsquo;t I welcome Bertha&rsquo;s visit at once?&hellip; It&rsquo;s
all so small, so petty&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she shrugged her shoulders under her umbrella, laughed at
herself a little, because she had shown herself so petty. <span class=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">At Addie&rsquo;s wish, at the little schoolboy&rsquo;s
wish, the Van der Welckes responded to Van Naghel&rsquo;s advances and
Constance sent a note. The visit was paid and the brothers-in-law shook
hands. Van der Welcke himself shrugged his shoulders over the whole
business; but Addie was pleased, started going for walks again with
Frans and spoke to Karel again at the grammar-school, though he did not
much care for him. Two days later, Marianne called in the afternoon,
when the rain was coming down in torrents. Constance was at home. The
girl stood in the door-way of the drawing-room:</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I come in, Auntie?&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, Marianne, do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like to: I&rsquo;m rather wet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, come in!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the girl suddenly ran in and threw herself on her knees beside
Constance, almost with a scream:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am so glad, I am so glad!&rdquo; she cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That Uncle wrote to Papa &hellip; that Papa and Mamma have
been here &hellip; that everything is all right again&#8202;&hellip;.
It was so dreadful; it kept me from sleeping. I kept on thinking about
it. It <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb40" href="#pb40" name=
"pb40">40</a>]</span>was a sort of nightmare, an obsession. Auntie,
dear Auntie, is everything all right now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, certainly, child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really all right?&hellip; Are you coming to us again &hellip;
and may I come and see you &hellip; and will you ask me to dinner again
soon? Is everything all right, really all right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She snuggled up to her aunt like a child, putting her head against
Constance&rsquo; knees, stroking her hands:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will ask me again soon, Auntie, won&rsquo;t you? I love
coming to you, I simply love it. I should have missed it so, I
can&rsquo;t tell you how much&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her voice broke, as she knelt by Constance&rsquo; side, and she
suddenly burst into tears, sobbing out her words so excitedly that
Constance was startled, thinking it almost unnatural, absurd:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was nearly coming to you before Papa and Mamma had
been&#8202;&hellip;. But I didn&rsquo;t dare&#8202;&hellip;. I was
afraid Papa would be angry&#8202;&hellip;. But I can come now,
it&rsquo;s all right now&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s all right now&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She kissed Marianne. But the door opened and Van der Welcke
entered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you do, Uncle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He always thought it odd when Marianne called him uncle, just like
that:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it you, Marianne?&hellip; Constance, did I leave my
<i>Figaro</i> down here?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb41"
href="#pb41" name="pb41">41</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;The <i>Figaro</i>? No&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He hunted for his paper and then sat down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle,&rdquo; said Marianne, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just been
telling Auntie, I&rsquo;m so glad, I&rsquo;m so glad that
everything&rsquo;s settled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So am I, Marianne.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Outside, the rain came pelting down, lashed by the howling wind.
Inside, all was cosiness, with Constance pouring out the tea and
telling them about Nice, while Marianne talked about Emilie and Van
Raven and how they were not getting on very well together and how Otto
and Frances were also beginning to squabble and how Mamma took it all
to heart and allowed it to depress her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t get married,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I
see nothing but unhappy marriages around me. I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t get
married.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she started. She had a knack of behaving awkwardly and
tactlessly, of saying things which she ought not to say. Van der Welcke
looked at her, smiling. To make up for her indiscretion, she was more
demonstrative than ever, profuse in exclamations of delight:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Auntie, how glad I am to be with you once more!&hellip; I
must be off presently in the rain&#8202;&hellip;. I wish I could
stay&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But stay and dine,&rdquo; said Van der Welcke.</p>
<p>Constance hesitated: she saw that Marianne would like to stop on and
she did not know what to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb42" href=
"#pb42" name="pb42">42</a>]</span>do, did not wish to seem ungracious;
and yet&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you stay to dinner?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>Marianne beamed with joy:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I should love to, Auntie! Mamma knows I&rsquo;m here;
she&rsquo;ll understand&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Constance was sorry that she had asked her; her nerves were feeling
the strain of it all; but she was determined to control herself, to
behave naturally and ordinarily. She could see it plainly: they were
too fond of each other!</p>
<p>They were in love! Long before, she had seemed to guess it, when she
saw them together, at her little dinners. The veriest trifle&mdash;an
intonation of voice, a laughing phrase, the passing of a dish of
fruit&mdash;had made her seem to guess it. Then the vague thought that
went through her mind, like a little cloud, would vanish at once,
leaving not even a shadow behind it. But the cloud had come drifting
again and again, brought by a gesture, a glance, a how-do-you-do or
good-bye, an appointment for a bicycle ride. On such occasions, the
brothers had always gone too&mdash;so had Addie&mdash;and there had
never been anything that was in the least incorrect; and at the little
dinners there was never a joke that went too far, nor an attempt at
flirtation, nor the very least resemblance to love-making. And
therefore those vague thoughts had always drifted away again, like
clouds; and Constance would think: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb43"
href="#pb43" name="pb43">43</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;There is nothing, there is nothing. I am mistaken. I am
imagining something that doesn&rsquo;t exist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had not seen them together for two months; and she knew, had
understood from a word dropped here and there, that Van der Welcke had
not seen Marianne during those two months which had passed since that
Sunday evening. And now, suddenly, she was struck by it: the shy,
almost glad hesitation while the girl was standing at the door of
Constance&rsquo; drawing-room; her unconcealed delight at being able to
come back to this house; the almost unnatural joy with which she had
sobbed at Constance&rsquo; knee &hellip; until Van der Welcke came in,
after doubtless recognizing the sound of her voice in his little
smoking-room, as transparent as a child, with his clumsy excuse of
searching for a newspaper. And now at once she was struck by it: the
almost insuppressible affection with which they had greeted each other,
with a certain smiling radiance that beamed from them, involuntarily,
irresistibly, unconsciously&#8202;&hellip;. But still Constance
thought:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am mistaken, there is nothing; and I am imagining something
that doesn&rsquo;t exist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the thought passed away, that they were really in love with each
other; only this time there remained a faint wonder, a doubt, which had
never been there before. And, while she talked about <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb44" href="#pb44" name="pb44">44</a>]</span>Nice, it
struck her that Van der Welcke was still there &hellip; that he was
staying on in her drawing-room, a thing which he never did except when
Paul was there, or Gerrit&#8202;&hellip;. He sat on, without saying
much; but that happy smile never left his lips&#8202;&hellip;. Yet she
still thought:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am mistaken; it is only imagination; there is nothing, or
at most a little mutual attraction; and what harm is there in
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But, be this as it might, she, who was so jealous where her son was
concerned, now felt not the least shade of jealousy amid her wondering
doubts. Yes, it was all gone, any love, passion, sentiment that she had
ever entertained for Henri. It was quite dead&#8202;&hellip;. And, now
that he smiled like that, she noticed, with a sort of surprise, how
young he was:</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is thirty-eight,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;and looks even
younger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he sat there, calmly, always with the light of a smile on his
face, it struck her that he was very young, with a healthy, youthful
freshness, and that he had not a wrinkle, not a grey hair in his
head&#8202;&hellip;. His blue eyes were almost the eyes of a child.
Even Addie&rsquo;s eyes, though they were like his father&rsquo;s, were
more serious, had an older look&#8202;&hellip;. And, at the sight of
that youthfulness, she thought herself old, even though she was now
showing Marianne the pretty photograph from Nice&#8202;&hellip;. Yes,
she felt old; and she was hardly surprised&mdash;<span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb45" href="#pb45" name="pb45">45</a>]</span>if it
was so, if she was not mistaken&mdash;at that youthfulness in her
husband and at his possible love for that young girl&#8202;&hellip;.
Marianne&rsquo;s youth seemed to be nearer to his own
youth&#8202;&hellip;. And sometimes it was so evident that she almost
ceased doubting and promised herself to be careful, not to encourage
Marianne, not to invite her any more&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>Unconscious: was it unconscious, thought Constance, on their part?
Had they ever exchanged a more affectionate word, a pressure of the
hand, a glance? Had they already confessed it to each other &hellip;
and to themselves? And a delicate intuition told her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, they have confessed nothing to each other; no, they have
not even confessed anything to themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Perhaps neither of them knew it yet; and, if so, Constance was the
only one who knew. She looked at Marianne: the girl was very young,
even though she had been out a year or two. She had something of
Emilie&rsquo;s fragility, but she was more natural, franker; and that
natural frankness showed in her whole attitude: she seemed not to
think, but to allow herself to be dragged along by impulse, by
sentiment&#8202;&hellip;. She looked out with her smile at the pelting
rain, nestled deeper in her chair, luxuriously, like a kitten, then
suddenly jumped up, poured out a cup of tea for Constance and herself;
and, when Van der Welcke begged his wife&rsquo;s leave to smoke a
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb46" href="#pb46" name=
"pb46">46</a>]</span>cigarette, she sprang up again, struck a match,
held the light to him, with a fragile grace of gesture like a little
statue. Her pale-brown eyes, with a touch of gold-dust over them, were
like chrysolite; and they gazed up enthusiastically and then cast their
glance downwards timidly, under the shade of their lids. She was pale,
with the an&aelig;mic pallor of alabaster, the pallor of our jaded
society-girls; and her hands moved feverishly and restlessly, as though
the fingers were constantly seeking an object for their butterfly
sensitiveness&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>Was it so? Or was it all Constance&rsquo; imagination? And, amidst
her wondering doubts, there came suddenly&mdash;if it really was
so&mdash;a spasm of jealousy; but not jealousy of her husband&rsquo;s
love: jealousy of his youth. She suddenly looked back fifteen years and
felt herself grown old, felt him remaining young. Life, real life, for
which she sometimes had a vague yearning, while she felt herself too
old for it, after frittering away her days: that life he would perhaps
still be able to live, if he met with it. He at least was not too old
for it!</p>
<p>It all filled her with a passion of misery and anger; and then again
she thought:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, there is nothing; and I am imagining all manner of things
that do not exist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Addie came home; and, with the rain pelting outside, there was a
gentle cosiness indoors, at table. Constance was silent, but the others
were cheerful. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb47" href="#pb47" name=
"pb47">47</a>]</span>And, when, after tea had been served, the fury out
of doors seemed to have subsided, Marianne stood up, almost too
unwilling to go away:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s time for me to go,
Auntie&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall Addie see you home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Addie&rsquo;s working,&rdquo; said Van der Welcke.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see Marianne home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Constance said nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Auntie,&rdquo; said Marianne, &ldquo;I am so glad that
everything&rsquo;s settled!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She kissed Constance passionately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle, isn&rsquo;t it a nuisance for you to go all that way
with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I had a bicycle for you!&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, if only we had our tandem here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s stopped raining; we shall be able to
walk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They went, leaving Constance alone. Her eyes were eager to follow
them along the street. She could not help herself, softly opened a
window, looked out into the damp winter night. She saw them go towards
the Bankastraat. They were walking side by side, quite ordinarily. She
watched them for a minute or two, until they turned the corner:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;there is nothing. Oh, it would be
too dreadful!&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb48" href="#pb48"

<p class="first">Van der Welcke and Marianne went side by side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How deliciously fresh it is now,&rdquo; she almost carolled.
&ldquo;The wind has gone down and the air is lovely; and look, how
beautiful the sky is with those last black clouds&#8202;&hellip;. Oh, I
think it so ripping, that everything&rsquo;s all right again between
you and Papa! I did feel it so. You know how fond I am of both of you,
Aunt Constance and you, and of Addie; and it was all so
sad&#8202;&hellip;. Tell me, does Auntie still feel bitter about it? I
expect she does&#8202;&hellip;. Ah, I understand quite well now
&hellip; that she would have liked to come to our house &hellip;
officially, let me say! But why not first have spoken to Mamma &hellip;
or to me, who am so fond of you? Then we could have seen: we might have
thought of something. As it was, Mamma was so startled by that
unexpected visit&#8202;&hellip;. Poor Aunt Constance, she isn&rsquo;t
happy! How sad that you and she aren&rsquo;t happier together! Oh, I
could cry about it at times: it seems such a shame!&hellip; A man and
woman married &hellip; and then &hellip; and then what I so often
see!&hellip; I oughtn&rsquo;t to have said what I did before dinner, it
was stupid of me; but I may speak now, mayn&rsquo;t I?&hellip; Oh, I
sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t marry, I won&rsquo;t marry!&hellip; To be married
like Otto and Frances, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb49" href="#pb49"
name="pb49">49</a>]</span>like Emilie and Van Raven: I think it
dreadful. Or like you and Auntie: I should think it dreadful.
Can&rsquo;t you be happier together? Not even for Addie&rsquo;s sake? I
wish you could; it would make me so happy. I can&rsquo;t bear it, when
you and Auntie quarrel&#8202;&hellip;. She was sweet and gentle
to-night, but so very quiet. She is so nice&#8202;&hellip;. That was a
mad fit of hers, to go abroad so suddenly; but then she had had so much
to vex her. Oh, those two old aunts: I could have murdered them! I can
hear them now!&hellip; Poor Auntie! Do try and be a little nice to
her&#8202;&hellip;. Has this been going on between you for years?
Don&rsquo;t you love each other any longer?&hellip; No, I
sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t marry, I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t marry, I shall never
marry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, Marianne: if some one comes along whom you get to
love&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I shall never marry&#8202;&hellip;. I might expect too
much of my husband. I should really want to find something beautiful,
some great joy, in my love &hellip; and to marry for the sake of
marrying, like Frances or Emilie, is a thing I couldn&rsquo;t,
couldn&rsquo;t do&#8202;&hellip;. Otto is fonder of Louise than of his
wife; and lately Emilie and Henri are inseparable&#8202;&hellip;. In
our family there has always been that affection between brother and
sister. But it is too strong, far too strong. It doesn&rsquo;t make
them happy. I&rsquo;ve never felt it in that way, fond as I am of my
brothers&#8202;&hellip;. No, I should place the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb50" href="#pb50" name="pb50">50</a>]</span>man I
love above everybody, above everybody&#8202;&hellip;. But I suppose
you&rsquo;re laughing &hellip; at my bread-and-butter
notions&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not laughing, Marianne; and, just as you would
like to see Aunt Constance and me happy, so I should like to see you
happy &hellip; with a man whom you loved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will never be, Uncle; no, that will never be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can you tell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I feel it, I feel it!&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, I&rsquo;ll have a bet on it,&rdquo; he said,
laughingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Uncle,&rdquo; she said, with a pained smile, &ldquo;I
won&rsquo;t bet on a thing like that&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to hurt you,
Marianne&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know that&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you mustn&rsquo;t be so melancholy, at your age.
You&rsquo;re so young&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twenty-one. That&rsquo;s quite old.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old! Old! What about me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She laughed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re young! A man&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is always young?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not always. But you are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A young uncle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, a young uncle&#8202;&hellip;. A woman gets old
quicker&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb51"
href="#pb51" name="pb51">51</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;So, when you&rsquo;re old and I am still young, we shall be
about the same age.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She laughed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a calculation! No, you&rsquo;re older. But age
doesn&rsquo;t go by years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. I sometimes have very young wishes. Do you know what I
have been longing for since yesterday, like a baby, like a
boy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A motor-car.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She laughed, with a laugh like little tinkling bells:</p>
<p>&ldquo;A motor-car?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t it be delightful? To go tearing and tearing
over fields and roads, through clouds of
dust&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re becoming poetic!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s making me poetic&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the smell of the petrol?&hellip; The mask and goggles
against the dust?&hellip; The hideous dress?&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s nothing!&hellip; To tear and fly along,
faster and faster, at a mad pace&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have never been in a
motor-car&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1141src"
href="#xd26e1141" name="xd26e1141src">1</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;I have, in Brussels, in a friend&rsquo;s car. There&rsquo;s
nothing to come up to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her laugh tinkled out again:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, now you&rsquo;re most certainly like a boy!&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb52" href="#pb52" name=
"pb52">52</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so young?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O young Uncle!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You oughtn&rsquo;t to call me uncle, Marianne: I&rsquo;m too
young for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tinkling bells:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What am I to call you then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything you like. Not uncle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nunkie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t call you Henri &hellip; or Van der
Welcke?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s too difficult. Better say
nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tinkling bells:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing. Very well&#8202;&hellip;. But am I to say <i lang=
"nl">U</i> or <i lang="nl">je</i>?&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e1182src" href="#xd26e1182" name="xd26e1182src">2</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Say <i lang="nl">je</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it seems so funny &hellip; before people!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;People, people! You can&rsquo;t always bother about
people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I have to: I&rsquo;m a girl!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Marianne, people are always a nuisance!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A desert island would be the thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, a desert island&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With a motor-car&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And just you and me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They both laughed; and her little bells tinkled through his boyish
laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a perfect night!&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb53" href="#pb53" name="pb53">53</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Perfect: the air is so crisp&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marianne&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Uncle&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not uncle&#8202;&hellip;. You must be my little
friend&#8202;&hellip;. Not a niece&#8202;&hellip;. I&rsquo;ve never had
a girl-friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your little friend?&hellip; But I am!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look, how dark it is in the Wood&#8202;&hellip;. People say
it&rsquo;s dangerous. Is it, Uncle? No, I didn&rsquo;t mean to say
uncle&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes. Are you frightened? Take my arm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not frightened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, take my arm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall be home in a minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only Mamma isn&rsquo;t angry with me, for staying
out&#8202;&hellip;. Are you coming in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No &hellip; no&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not because you&rsquo;re still angry with us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not angry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right. Oh, I am glad! I should like to give
you a motor for making me so happy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those old tin kettles cost a lot of
money&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor Uncle! No, I don&rsquo;t mean
uncle&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here we are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He rang the bell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you for seeing me home.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb54" href="#pb54" name="pb54">54</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-night, Marianne.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The butler opened the door; she went in. He trotted back, whistling
like a boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wherever have you been, Marianne?&rdquo; asked Bertha.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I stayed to dinner at Aunt Constance&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was anxious about you,&rdquo; said Bertha.</p>
<p>But she was glad that Constance had been so gracious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who brought you home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She ran up to her room. She looked in the glass, as though to read
her own eyes. There she read her secret:</p>
<p>&ldquo;God help me!&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;I oughtn&rsquo;t to
have gone. I oughtn&rsquo;t to have gone. I was too weak, too
weak&#8202;&hellip;. Oh, if only they had never made it up, Papa and
&hellip; he!&hellip; Oh dear! I shall never go there again. It&rsquo;s
the last time, the last time&#8202;&hellip;. O God, help me, help
me!&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She sank into a chair and sat with her face hidden in her hands, not
weeping, her happiness still shedding its dying rays around her, but
with a rising agony; and she remained like that for a long time, with
her eyes closed, as though she were dreaming and suffering, both.

<p class="first">&ldquo;And who do you think&rsquo;s in town?&rdquo;
Van Vreeswijck asked Van der Welcke, as they were walking together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brauws.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brauws?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Max Brauws.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Max? Never! What, Leiden Max?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Leiden Max. I hadn&rsquo;t seen him for
years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor I, of course. And what is he doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s a difficult question to answer. Shall I
say, being eccentric?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eccentric? In what way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, in the things he does. First one thing and then another.
He&rsquo;s giving lectures now. In fact, he&rsquo;s a
Bohemian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you spoken to him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he asked after you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should like to see him. Does he belong to the
Witte?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t think so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a mad fellow. Always was mad. An interesting chap,
though. And a good sort. Has he money?&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb56" href="#pb56" name="pb56">56</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is he staying?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In rooms, in the Buitenhof.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re close by. Let&rsquo;s go and see if he&rsquo;s
in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brauws was not in. And Van der Welcke left a card for his old
college-chum, with a pencilled word.</p>
<p>A fortnight passed; and Van der Welcke began to feel annoyed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard nothing from Brauws,&rdquo; he said to Van
Vreeswijck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen him either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he&rsquo;s offended about something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, Brauws isn&rsquo;t that sort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Van der Welcke was silent. Since the scene with the family, he was
unduly sensitive, thinking that people were unfriendly, that they
avoided him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if he wants to ignore my card, let him!&rdquo; he said,
angrily. &ldquo;He can go to the devil, for all I care!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But, a couple of days later, when Van der Welcke was smoking in his
little room, Truitje brought in a card.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brauws!&rdquo; exclaimed Van der Welcke.</p>
<p>And he rushed outside:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come upstairs, old chap!&rdquo; he shouted, from the
landing.</p>
<p>In the hall stood a big, quiet man, looking up with a smile round
his thick moustache.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I come up?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb57"
href="#pb57" name="pb57">57</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, come up. Upon my word, Max, I am
glad&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brauws came upstairs; the two men gripped each other&rsquo;s
hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Welckje!&rdquo; said Brauws. &ldquo;Mad Hans!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Van der Welcke laughed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, those were my nicknames. My dear chap, what an age since
we&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took him to his den, made him sit down, produced cigars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, thanks, I don&rsquo;t smoke. I&rsquo;m glad to see you.
Why, Hans, you haven&rsquo;t changed a bit. You&rsquo;re a little
stouter; and that&rsquo;s all. Just look at the fellow! You could pass
for your own son. How old are you? You&rsquo;re thirty-eight &hellip;
getting on for thirty-nine. And now just look at me. I&rsquo;m three
years your senior; but I look old enough to be your father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Van der Welcke laughed, pleased and flattered by the compliment paid
to his youth. Their Leiden memories came up; they reminded each other
of a score of incidents, speaking and laughing together in unfinished,
breathless sentences which they understood at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what have you been doing all this time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, a lot! Too much to tell you all at once. And
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I? Nothing, nothing. You know I&rsquo;m married?&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb58" href="#pb58" name=
"pb58">58</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know,&rdquo; said Brauws. &ldquo;But what do you do?
You&rsquo;re in a government-office, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Lord no, old fellow! Nothing, I just do nothing. I
cycle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They both laughed. Brauws looked at his old college-friend, almost
paternally, with a quiet smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The beggar hasn&rsquo;t changed an atom,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Yes, now that I look at you again, I see something here and
there. But you&rsquo;ve remained Welckje, for all
that&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But not Mad Hans,&rdquo; sighed Van der Welcke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vreeswijck has become a great swell,&rdquo; said Brauws.
&ldquo;And the others?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Greater swells still.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not I. Do you cycle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you a motor-car?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a pity. I should like to have a motor. But I
can&rsquo;t afford one of those sewing-machines.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brauws roared with laughter:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you start saving up for one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, old chap, no&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, do you know what&rsquo;s a funny thing? While you were
living in Brussels, I too was living just outside Brussels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I was.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb59" href=
"#pb59" name="pb59">59</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;And we never met?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I so seldom went into town. If I had
known&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what a pity!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. And what&rsquo;s still funnier is that, when you were on
the Riviera, I was there too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, old fellow, you&rsquo;re kidding me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never knew till later that you were there also that year.
But you were at Monte Carlo and I at Antibes. Just compare the
dates.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They compared dates: Brauws was right.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that was horribly unlucky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It couldn&rsquo;t be helped. However, we&rsquo;ve found each
other now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. We must see something of each other now, eh? Let&rsquo;s
go cycling together &hellip; or buy a motor-car between us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brauws roared with laughter again:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Happy devil!&rdquo; he shouted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I?&rdquo; cried Van der Welcke, a little huffed.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s there happy about me? I sometimes feel very
miserable, very miserable indeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brauws understood that he was referring to his marriage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s my boy,&rdquo; said Van der Welcke, showing
Addie&rsquo;s photograph.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A good face. What&rsquo;s he going to be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s going into the diplomatic service. I say, shall we
take a stroll?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb60" href="#pb60"
name="pb60">60</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;d rather sit here and talk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re just as placid as
ever&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brauws laughed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Outwardly, perhaps,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Inwardly,
I&rsquo;m anything but placid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you been abroad much?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Much &hellip; and perhaps nothing. I am
seeking&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t explain it in a few words. Perhaps later, when
we&rsquo;ve seen more of each other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the same queer chap that you always were.
<i>What</i>are you seeking?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s our old oracle. &lsquo;Something!&rsquo; You
were always fond of those short words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The universe lies in a word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Max, I can&rsquo;t follow you, if you go on like that. I
never could, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me about yourself now, about Rome, about
Brussels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Van der Welcke, smoking, described his life, more or less briefly,
through the blue clouds of his cigarette. Brauws listened:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Women&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had a habit of not finishing his sentences, or of saying only a
single word. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb61" href="#pb61" name=
"pb61">61</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;And what have women done to you?&rdquo; asked Van der Welcke,
gaily.</p>
<p>Brauws laughed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing much,&rdquo; he said, jestingly. &ldquo;Not worth
talking about. There have been many women in my life &hellip; and yet
they were not there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Van der Welcke reflected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Women,&rdquo; he said, pensively. &ldquo;Sometimes, you
know&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hans, are you in love?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; said Van der Welcke, starting. &ldquo;No,
I&rsquo;ve been fairly good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fairly good?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, only fairly&#8202;&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re in love,&rdquo; said Brauws, decisively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re mad!&rdquo; said Van der Welcke. &ldquo;I
wasn&rsquo;t thinking of myself&#8202;&hellip;. And, now, what are you
doing in the Hague?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brauws laughed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to give lectures, not only here, but all over
Holland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lectures?&rdquo; cried Van der Welcke, in astonishment.
&ldquo;What made you think of that? Do you do it to make money?
Don&rsquo;t you find it a bore to stand jawing in front of a lot of
people for an hour at a time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a bit,&rdquo; said Brauws. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m lecturing on
Peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peace?&rdquo; cried Van der Welcke, his blue orbs
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb62" href="#pb62" name=
"pb62">62</a>]</span>shining in wide-eyed young amazement through the
blue haze of his cigarette-smoke. &ldquo;What Peace?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Peace</i>, simply.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re getting at me,&rdquo; cried Van der Welcke.</p>
<p>Brauws roared; and Van der Welcke too. They laughed for quite a
minute or two.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hans,&rdquo; said Brauws, &ldquo;how is it possible for any
one to change as little as you have done? In all these years! You are
just as incapable as in the old days of believing in anything
serious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you imagine that there&rsquo;s been nothing serious in my
life,&rdquo; said Van der Welcke, vexed.</p>
<p>And, with great solemnity, he once more told his friend about
Constance, about his marriage, his shattered career.</p>
<p>Brauws smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You laugh, as if it all didn&rsquo;t matter!&rdquo; cried Van
der Welcke, angrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does anything matter?&rdquo; said Brauws.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And your old Peace?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very little as yet, at any rate&#8202;&hellip;. Perhaps
later&#8202;&hellip;. Luckily, there&rsquo;s the future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Van der Welcke shrugged his shoulders and demolished Peace in a
few ready-made sentences: there would always be war; it was one of
those Utopian ideas&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>Brauws only smiled. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb63" href="#pb63"
name="pb63">63</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;You must come and dine one day, to meet Vreeswijck,&rdquo;
said Van der Welcke.</p>
<p>Brauws&rsquo; smile disappeared suddenly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, my dear fellow, honestly&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not the man for dinners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be a dinner. Only Vreeswijck. My wife will be
very pleased.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but I shall be putting your wife
out&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a bit. I&rsquo;ll see if she&rsquo;s at home and
introduce you to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, my dear fellow, no, honestly&#8202;&hellip;. I&rsquo;m no
ladies&rsquo; man. I&rsquo;m nothing of a drawing-room person. I never
know what to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You surely haven&rsquo;t grown shy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, almost. With ladies &hellip; I really don&rsquo;t know
what to say. No, old chap, honestly&#8202;&hellip;..&rdquo;</p>
<p>His voice was full of anxious dismay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s mean of you, to refuse to come and dine
with us, quite quietly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes &hellip; and then it&rsquo;ll be a dinner of twenty
people. I know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t know where to get them from. We see nobody.
Nobody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no&#8202;&hellip;. Well, yes, perhaps later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He raised his hand deprecatingly, almost impatiently:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s go for a
walk.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb64" href="#pb64" name=
"pb64">64</a>]</span></p>
<p>And, as though fearing lest Van der Welcke should still find a
moment to introduce him to his wife, Brauws hurried him down the
stairs. Once outside, he breathed again, recovered his usual placidity.

<h2 class="main">Chapter IX</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;I went last night with Van Vreeswijck to hear
Brauws speak at Diligentia,&rdquo; said Van der Welcke, one morning.
&ldquo;The fellow&rsquo;s inspired. He speaks extempore and
magnificently; he&rsquo;s an orator. A splendid fellow, the way he
spoke: it was astounding&#8202;&hellip;. I knew him years ago at
Leiden. He was a queer chap even then. He did not belong to any
particular club, not to ours either: his family is nothing out of the
way. His father has a factory, I believe, somewhere in Overijssel. He
himself has nothing of the tradesman about him. He used to coach us
dull beggars and help us get up our examinations. I should never have
passed without him. He knows about everything, he&rsquo;s not only good
at law. He&rsquo;s read everything; he has a tremendous memory.
He&rsquo;s travelled a lot and done all sorts of things, but I
can&rsquo;t find out exactly what. Now he&rsquo;s lecturing. This
evening, he&rsquo;s lecturing in Amsterdam. I asked him to dinner, but
he refuses to come, says he&rsquo;s shy with ladies. Silly
fellow!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The newspapers printed lengthy reports of Brauws&rsquo; speeches on
Peace. He spoke in all the large Dutch towns and in many of the smaller
ones. When he was to speak at the Hague for the second time, Van der
Welcke said, excitedly: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb66" href=
"#pb66" name="pb66">66</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Constance, you must absolutely go and hear Brauws this
evening. He&rsquo;s grand. You know, I can never listen to any one for
more than a quarter of an hour&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor I for more than three minutes,&rdquo; said Paul, who was
there. &ldquo;But I love to talk for an hour on end myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Brauws: the fellow electrifies you. Though I think that
Peace idea of his all rot. But that makes no difference: the chap
speaks magnificently&#8202;&hellip;. I&rsquo;m dining with Van
Vreeswijck and we&rsquo;re going on together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Paul asked Constance to go with him. That evening, the little hall
of Diligentia&mdash;the proceeds were to go to the fund for the Boer
wounded&mdash;was full: Constance and Paul had difficulty in finding
seats.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All sorts of people,&rdquo; Paul observed. &ldquo;A curious
audience. An olla podrida of every set in the Hague. Here and there,
the very select people have turned up, no doubt brought by Van
Vreeswijck: look, there are the Van der Heuvel Steijns; and
there&rsquo;s the French minister; and there, as I live, is Van Naghel,
with his colleague from the Treasury&#8202;&hellip;. And look,
there&rsquo;s Isidore the hairdresser&#8202;&hellip;. A bit of
everything, a bit of everything&#8202;&hellip;. How brotherly and
sisterly the Hague has become this evening: it makes me feel quite
sentimental!&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb67" href="#pb67"
name="pb67">67</a>]</span></p>
<p>Brauws made his entrance, to faint applause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fellow&rsquo;s not in evening-dress; he&rsquo;s wearing a
frock-coat. I suppose he&rsquo;s playing the demagogue or the
preacher.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But he had to stop, for Brauws at once began to speak from the
rostrum. He had nothing with him, not a note; and his voice was firm
but very gentle. He began with a masterly exposition of the present
political situation, sketching it in broad outlines, like an enormous
picture, for all those people in front of him. His voice became
clearer; his eyes looked through the hall, steady and bright, like two
shining stars. Constance, who seldom read any political news, listened,
was at once interested, wondered vaguely for a moment that she lived
like that, from day to day, without knowing the times in which she
lived. The present took shape before her in those few sentences of
Brauws&rsquo;. Then he spoke of Peace, which would be essential sooner
or later, which was already making its joyous way into the mind of the
nations, even though they were actually still waging war upon one
another. It was as though wide and radiant vistas opened under his
words; and his voice, at first so gentle, now rang through the hall,
triumphantly confirming the glad tidings. He spoke without pausing, for
two hours on end; and, when he stopped, the hall was breathless for a
moment, the audience forgot to cheer. Then indeed applause <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb68" href="#pb68" name="pb68">68</a>]</span>burst
forth, jubilant; but by that time Brauws was gone. They called him
back, but he did not return; and the audience streamed out.</p>
<p>Constance and Paul were in the crush, when they saw Van Vreeswijck
and Van der Welcke behind them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mevrouw,&rdquo; said Van Vreeswijck, bowing. &ldquo;What do
you think of our friend?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonderful,&rdquo; said Constance, excitedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fellow speaks well,&rdquo; said Paul, &ldquo;but he is
too earnest. He means all he says. People don&rsquo;t like that in the
long run.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Van der Welcke protested vehemently, as he pushed through the
close-packed crowd, and declared that he was converted, that he
believed in Peace.</p>
<p>They reached the street: the hum of the crowd floated through the
wintry air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How excited our stolid Haguers are!&rdquo; said Paul.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s our man,&rdquo; said Van Vreeswijck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, there he is!&rdquo; exclaimed Van der Welcke.</p>
<p>And he darted forwards, stopped Brauws, who was walking fast and saw
nobody, and seized his hand. The others drew near. Van Vreeswijck, out
of politeness, stayed by Constance, waved his hand to Brauws. Van der
Welcke was in a great state of excitement:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; they heard him ask Brauws.
&ldquo;To the Witte?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb69" href=
"#pb69" name="pb69">69</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;No, my dear fellow, home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Home? <i>Can</i> you go home now? Won&rsquo;t you come to the
Witte? I say, do let me introduce you to my wife, to my
brother-in-law&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brauws started:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Hans, honestly&#8202;&hellip;. No, no&#8202;&hellip;.
What&rsquo;s the good?&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Constance heard and could not help smiling. She walked on with Van
Vreeswijck and Paul.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; Van der Welcke insisted.</p>
<p>Brauws no doubt realized that Constance had heard, for he said, in a
voice of despair:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well then, Hans&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Constance! Paul!&rdquo; cried Van der Welcke, proud of his
friend, and caught them up.</p>
<p>He would have liked to introduce Brauws to the whole world, to the
whole audience streaming out of Diligentia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me introduce you: my friend, Max Brauws; my wife; my
brother-in-law, Van Lowe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They shook hands. Brauws remained standing in front of Constance,
shyly and awkwardly. She tried to pay him a compliment that would not
sound too obvious; and, like the tactful woman that she was, she
succeeded. Paul also said something; they walked on, Van Vreeswijck
silently amused at Van der Welcke&rsquo;s excitement and Brauws&rsquo;
awkwardness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And are you really going home? Won&rsquo;t you <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb70" href="#pb70" name="pb70">70</a>]</span>come to
the Witte?&rdquo; Van der Welcke urged, in imploring tones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Hans, what would you have me do at the
Witte?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re going home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m going home, but I&rsquo;ll walk a bit of the
way with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And, wishing to appear polite, he bowed vaguely to Constance, but
said nothing more.</p>
<p>It was a delightful winter evening, with a sharp frost and a sky
full of twinkling stars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I love walking,&rdquo; said Constance. &ldquo;When I&rsquo;ve
heard anything fine&mdash;music, a play, or a speech like
to-night&rsquo;s&mdash;I would much rather walk than rattle home in a
cab.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear fellow!&rdquo; cried Van der Welcke, still bubbling
over with enthusiasm. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve converted me! I believe in
it, I believe in that Peace of yours!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brauws gave a sudden bellow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, now the chap&rsquo;s laughing at me again!&rdquo; said
Van der Welcke, in an injured tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Brauws, &ldquo;shall I come and fetch you
in a motor to-morrow, to reward you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They all laughed this time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you got one?&rdquo; cried Van der Welcke,
delightedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but I can hire one,&rdquo; said Brauws. &ldquo;And then
you can drive.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb71" href="#pb71"
name="pb71">71</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you hire one? Can you hire one?&rdquo; cried Van der
Welcke, in delighted amazement. &ldquo;And may I really
drive?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And forgetting all about Peace, he was soon eagerly discussing
motor-cars and motor-cycles&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>When they reached the Kerkhoflaan, Constance asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you all come in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Van Vreeswijck and Paul said that they would be glad to come and
have a glass of wine; but Brauws said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mevrouw, it&rsquo;s so late&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come along, Max,&rdquo; said Van der Welcke.</p>
<p>But Brauws laughed his queer, soft laugh and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the good of my coming in?&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he went off, with a shy bow. They all laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really, Brauws is impossible,&rdquo; said Van Vreeswijck,
indignantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he&rsquo;s forgotten to tell me at what time he&rsquo;s
coming for me with his old sewing-machine&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But next day, very early, in the misty winter morning, the
&ldquo;machine&rdquo; came puffing and snorting and exploding down the
Kerkhoflaan and stopped at Van der Welcke&rsquo;s door with a
succession of deep-drawn sighs and spasmodic gasps, as if to take
breath after its exertions; and this monster as it were of living
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb72" href="#pb72" name=
"pb72">72</a>]</span>and breathing iron, odorous of petrol&mdash;the
acrid smell of its sweat&mdash;was soon surrounded by a little group of
butchers&rsquo;-boys and orange-hawkers. Brauws stepped out; and, as
Constance happened to be coming downstairs, she received him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not fit to be seen, mevrouw. In these
&lsquo;sewing-machines,&rsquo; as Hans calls them, one becomes
unpresentable at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was shy, looked out at the gasping motor-car and smiled at the
crowd that had gathered round:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m causing quite a tumult outside your
door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They ought to be used to &lsquo;sewing-machines&rsquo; at the
Hague by now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a very graphic word of Hans&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They both laughed. She thought his laugh attractive and his voice
soft and restful to listen to.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mevrouw,&rdquo; he said, suddenly, overcoming his
bashfulness, &ldquo;I hope you were not angry that I was so ungracious
yesterday?&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you weren&rsquo;t at all ungracious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I was, very. But what excuse can I make? I have lost the
habit &hellip; of just talking&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She smiled:</p>
<p>&ldquo;To ladies,&rdquo; she said, jokingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, about nothing &hellip; you know &hellip; small
talk&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You really needn&rsquo;t apologize, Mr. Brauws. You had
already said so many delightful things last night that I can quite
understand&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb73"
href="#pb73" name="pb73">73</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but I have said nothing this morning
and&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t know what to say &hellip; about nothing.
But please don&rsquo;t trouble &hellip; and make yourself at home.
Henri will be down in a minute; he is very worried at not being
ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In fact, they heard Van der Welcke upstairs, dressing excitedly; he
was rushing madly round his room and shouting:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Addie! Addie! Pick me out a tie! Do be quick, boy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Constance rose to go. Brauws stopped her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mevrouw,&rdquo; he said, hurriedly, &ldquo;Hans asked me to
dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you refused&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you see, I&rsquo;m such a bear. Don&rsquo;t be angry
and don&rsquo;t let Hans be angry either and let me come and dine with
you one day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re inviting yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well; we shall be delighted to see you. When will you
come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whenever you like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With great pleasure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you rather come alone, or shall I ask Van Vreeswijck to
meet you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, certainly, Van Vreeswijck&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And nobody else.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb74"
href="#pb74" name="pb74">74</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;No, nobody. But I <span class="corr" id="xd26e1828" title=
"Source: musn&rsquo;t">mustn&rsquo;t</span> dictate to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t you, in this case?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Van der Welcke came rushing down the stairs, followed by Addie:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is jolly of you, Max! Let&rsquo;s have a look at the old
machine. She&rsquo;s a first-rater! And here&rsquo;s my
boy&#8202;&hellip;. Addie, eat a bit of bread and butter, quick; then
we&rsquo;ll drop you at your school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Addie laughed, quietly ate his bread and butter without sitting
down:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve lots of time,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So much the better &hellip; we&rsquo;ll drive you round a bit
first. Quick, quick! Take your bread and butter with you in your
hand!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He rushed like a madman through the dining-room and hall, hunted for
his hat, couldn&rsquo;t find it, shouted up the stairs, made Truitje
look all over the place for his gloves, created a breezy draught all
through the house. At last, he was ready:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only I can manage the old sewing-machine! &hellip;
Tock-tock-tock-tock, tock-tock-tock-tock!&hellip; Good-bye,
Constance&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shoved Addie in front of him, made him get into the car, settled
himself:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re off, Brauws!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye, mevrouw. Till to-morrow then!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He ran out. Constance looked out of the window: they drove off, with
Addie between them, waving <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb75" href=
"#pb75" name="pb75">75</a>]</span>his hand to her, while Brauws was
showing Van der Welcke&mdash;much too quick, too wild, too
impatient&mdash;how to work the &ldquo;sewing-machine&rdquo; and
obviously asking him to be careful&#8202;&hellip;. <span class=

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Constance had invited Van Vreeswijck at the last
moment and he was engaged, so that Brauws was the only guest. Though
Constance usually gave a deal of thought to her little dinners, she
received Brauws quite simply, treating him as one of themselves; and
Addie dined with them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now tell me what you have been doing all these
years?&rdquo; asked Van der Welcke.</p>
<p>Brauws tried to tell him, but kept on hesitating, as though under a
strange compulsion. His father was a manufacturer, owning big
iron-works in Overijssel, and still carried on that huge business with
Brauws&rsquo; two elder brothers, who were married to two sisters, the
daughters of another manufacturer, owning a cotton-mill in the same
district. But Max, who had been a queer boy from a child, had from a
child felt repelled by all that factory-life of masters and men, as he
saw it around him; and his father, recognizing his exceptional
intelligence, had sent him to college, hoping that in this way he would
carve out an honourable career for himself among his fellow-men. Max
was fond of study and studied long and hard, for the sake of study. At
Leiden, he became acquainted with Van Vreeswijck, Van der Welcke and
other young sprigs of the aristocracy, who would <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb77" href="#pb77" name="pb77">77</a>]</span>gladly
have admitted him to their club, putting up with him because he had
plenty of money to spend and because he was clever and it amused him to
help them in their examinations. Van der Welcke and Van Vreeswijck had
learnt to value his friendship, but nevertheless lost sight of him
afterwards, thinking that he had joined his brothers after all and was
managing the factory with them. And, even as they, as youths, had
hardly known their friend more than superficially, so they did not
know, on leaving Leiden, that Max had not gone to
Overijssel&mdash;where his father would have liked to marry him to the
third daughter of the father-in-law of his two other sons&mdash;but to
America, to &ldquo;seek.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, but to seek what?&rdquo; Van der Welcke asked, failing
to understand what a rich youth could want to seek in America, if he
did not see some idea, some plan, some object plainly outlined before
him.</p>
<p>Brauws now confessed that at the time he scarcely knew what he had
gone to seek, in America. He admitted that his father, the iron-master,
had hoped that Max would form industrial connections in America which
would have benefited the factory. But Max had formed no connections at
all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what <i>did</i> you do?&rdquo; asked Van der Welcke.</p>
<p>And Brauws smiled his strange, gentle smile, in which there gleamed
a touch of irony and compassion&mdash;with <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb78" href="#pb78" name="pb78">78</a>]</span>himself,
or the world, or both&mdash;a smile which sometimes broke into his big,
resonant laugh. He smiled and at last said, very slowly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I hardly dare confess to you, my dear Hans, what I did in
America. I don&rsquo;t talk about that time as a rule, because it all
sounds so strange, now that I am sitting at table with you and your
wife and your son. Perhaps, if I tell you what I did do in America,
Mrs. van der Welcke, after the first shock of surprise, will shudder at
having invited such a queer person to her table and probably think me a
very bad example for Addie. So don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s talk about
myself or what I did in America.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Van der Welcke had grown inquisitive:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, my dear fellow, you sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t get out of it
like that. I can&rsquo;t imagine that you did anything in America that
Addie mustn&rsquo;t hear about; and in any case he needn&rsquo;t take
you for his model. But I&rsquo;m burning with curiosity and I insist on
knowing what you were up to in America. Not lecturing on Peace all the
time?&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not even once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Hans, what&rsquo;s the good of talking about myself to
this extent?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re all interested, Mr. Brauws,&rdquo; said
Constance. &ldquo;We certainly are. But, if you would rather not talk
about those days, we will not be indiscreet.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb79" href="#pb79" name="pb79">79</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, yes,&rdquo; said Van der Welcke, impatiently.
&ldquo;By Jingo, I <i>will</i> be indiscreet. Max, I must
know&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; said Max Brauws, very simply and shyly, as
though he were making an apology. &ldquo;At the risk of your
wife&rsquo;s never asking me to her house again: I was a
porter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They all three looked at him and did not understand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A porter?&rdquo; asked Van der Welcke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A porter?&rdquo; asked Constance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, mevrouw: just a porter and dock-labourer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A dock-labourer?&rdquo; asked Van der Welcke, thinking, from
Max Brauws&rsquo; quiet voice, that he had suddenly gone mad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Hans; and, later on, I worked as a stoker in an
iron-works, like my father&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a stoker?&rdquo; asked Constance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, mevrouw, as a stoker in a factory. And then, afterwards,
as an engine-driver. And then&mdash;but that was very hard work&mdash;I
was a miner for a short time; but then I fell ill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A miner?&rdquo; asked Van der Welcke, in a blank voice, dazed
with astonishment.</p>
<p>And at last, recovering from the astonishment, he burst out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, Max, if you want to talk seriously, do; but
don&rsquo;t go pulling my leg and making a fool of me to my face. I
don&rsquo;t understand a word of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb80"
href="#pb80" name="pb80">80</a>]</span>what you&rsquo;re saying, unless
I&rsquo;m to suppose that your father was angry with you and gave you
no money and that you had to work for your bread, perhaps. But that you
were a porter&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And dock-labourer,&rdquo; said Constance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And engine-driver and miner, that I refuse to believe, unless
your father&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Hans, my father used to send me the same allowance
that he made me at the university: three hundred guilders a
month.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And&#8202;&hellip;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I used the money &hellip; for other things; but I lived
on my wages, like a labourer, as I really was. You see, you can&rsquo;t
understand that; and, as I feared, your wife thinks it horrible to be
sitting at table with a man who has been a porter, a dock-labourer and
a stoker&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And a miner,&rdquo; added Van der Welcke.</p>
<p>And he shut his eyes, as though he had received a blow on the
head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, mevrouw,&rdquo; said Brauws, with his quiet smile,
&ldquo;my hands, although they are not delicate, have become fit to
show again, as you see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he showed his hands, big, powerful hands, probably developed by
manual labour, but now neither coarse nor hard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But can you explain to me,&rdquo; asked Constance, with a
little laugh, &ldquo;why you worked in those various humble
capacities?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb81" href="#pb81"
name="pb81">81</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall we say, mevrouw, for the sake of being
eccentric?&rdquo; replied Brauws, almost coldly. &ldquo;And then we
will talk no more about myself. Tell me instead about Addie. Hans was
saying the other day that his ambition was to enter the diplomatic
service&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But a certain constraint seemed involuntarily to make the
conversation flag, as though both host and hostess were unable to
understand their guest at all, as though some one of another class had
actually strayed by accident into their dining-room, into the home of
these born aristocrats; and Constance, perceiving this, not only wanted
to avoid that constraint, but also a deeper feeling of invincible
sympathy made her regret almost unconsciously any misunderstanding or
unpleasantness that might arise between that strange man and Henri or
herself. This deeper feeling was so faint and unconscious that, at the
moment, she saw in it only her wish, as hostess, to make the passing
hour as agreeable as possible for her guest; and she did not hear the
deeper note in her voice when she said, with that candour and sincerity
which at times gave her an exquisitely feminine charm:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should be very sorry indeed, Mr. Brauws, if you refused to
go on speaking of yourself. You are an old and intimate friend of
Henri&rsquo;s; and, now that you two have met again, it would be a pity
if you refused to talk about the years when you did not see
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb82" href="#pb82" name=
"pb82">82</a>]</span>each other. But I am not speaking only for my
husband, who will speak for himself: I am speaking especially for my
own sake. When I heard you lecturing on Peace the other day&mdash;on
something which I had really never thought about, though I had heard
the word vaguely mentioned by people now and then&mdash;your speech
really roused &hellip; a sort of interest in me; and I listened with
keen sympathy; and afterwards I thought about that word. And, now that
you tell us that you have been a common workman in America, I am very
much interested to know how you came to adopt a life so very different
from that of the men in my set; and, if it is not too indiscreet, I
should like to ask you, as a favour, to speak about yourself and
explain what at present seems so perplexing to
me&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The simple, homely meal was finished; and they went into the
drawing-room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I stay, Mamma?&rdquo; asked Addie, who never accompanied
them to the drawing-room when there was a stranger present.</p>
<p>She laughed; and Van der Welcke said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, even my boy is curious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our future diplomatist!&rdquo; said Brauws, with his quiet
smile. &ldquo;Well, mevrouw, may he stay or not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course he may stay!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you afraid that the ideas of &hellip; a
labouring-man will spoil him?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb83" href="#pb83" name="pb83">83</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, there&rsquo;s no spoiling my boy!&rdquo; said she,
lifting her head high and putting her arm round Addie&rsquo;s shoulder
with motherly pride.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you don&rsquo;t make him vain, by saying that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no making him vain,&rdquo; she continued,
boasting a little, like a proud mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So he can stay?&rdquo; asked Brauws.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He can stay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, in that case I shall tell you more about
myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only in that case?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are giving me a proof of confidence and, I might almost
say, of sympathy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Van der Welcke took his friend by the shoulders:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Max, you pretend that you don&rsquo;t know how to
talk to &lsquo;ladies&rsquo; and there you stand, like a typical
courtier, paying compliments to my wife. That&rsquo;s all superfluous,
you know: here&rsquo;s a cup of coffee; sit down, make yourself at
home, choose your own chair; and now, Mr. Miner, tell your Mad Hans
how, when you were in America, you went even madder than he.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Brauws was obviously still seeking subterfuges, as though it
were impossible for him to interpret the riddle of his former existence
to these people who were entertaining him so kindly; and at last he
half managed to escape their pressing curiosity by saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t possibly tell you all that straight
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb84" href="#pb84" name=
"pb84">84</a>]</span>away&#8202;&hellip;. Perhaps later, mevrouw, when
I have known you a little longer, I may be able to tell you about that
time, so that you may understand it after a fashion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Constance was disappointed, but she said, with a smile:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I must exercise patience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I exercise no patience,&rdquo; said Van der Welcke.
&ldquo;Tell us now, Max: when you left Leiden, after taking your degree
in law, a year before I did&mdash;but you were much older than I, an
older student who really studied, a <i>rara avis</i>!&mdash;what did
you do then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I first went back to my father and my brothers, to the
factory. And then I took such an aversion to the whole thing, to all
that we represented, my father, my brothers and I, that I determined to
go and lead an entirely different life. I saw that, though my father
and brothers were comparatively good to their workmen, those workmen
remained slaves; and we&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He passed his hand over his forehead:</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can I and why should I talk about all this, my dear
Hans?&rdquo; he said, gently interrupting himself. &ldquo;You
wouldn&rsquo;t understand me; nor you either,
mevrouw&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t we understand you?&rdquo; asked
Constance. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb85" href="#pb85" name=
"pb85">85</a>]</span></p>
<p>His voice assumed a rough tone that almost frightened her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because both of you, you and Hans, are capitalists&mdash;and
titled capitalists at that&mdash;and because I&#8202;&hellip;. But I
don&rsquo;t want to be rude to my host and hostess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Capitalists without capital,&rdquo; said Van der Welcke,
laughing.</p>
<p>Brauws shrugged his shoulders:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are more of them than you think,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So really you&rsquo;re among enemies here,&rdquo; said
Constance, in her drawing-room voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Van der Welcke, &ldquo;for he in his turn has
deserted to the capitalists, even the titled ones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not quite,&rdquo; said Brauws, quietly, &ldquo;though I admit
that I have been weak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t press you any more, Mr. Brauws,&rdquo; said
Constance; but her voice urged him to continue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look upon yourself and Henri as my enemies,
mevrouw,&rdquo; said Brauws, earnestly. &ldquo;Above all things, I
should like to see nothing but friendship in this world of ours. But
you were asking me about America: well, when I had lived for a short
time with my father and my brothers in our big house near the factory,
it became too much for me; and I went away, to lead my life just as if
I had been born among workmen &hellip; so as to study them more
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb86" href="#pb86" name=
"pb86">86</a>]</span>closely, do you understand?&hellip; No, you
don&rsquo;t understand; and how can I go on?&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Max, you&rsquo;re being dull. And you&rsquo;re absurd
too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Hans, I simply can&rsquo;t talk about
myself: you see, I&rsquo;ve tried to, two or three times
over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we won&rsquo;t worry you any more,&rdquo; said
Constance.</p>
<p>A constraint seemed to have come upon them, a barrier which rose
between their words at every moment. Addie, disappointed, left the room
quietly. In a little while, Brauws took his leave, awkwardly, almost
rudely. Constance and Van der Welcke exchanged a glance when they were
alone. Van der Welcke shook his head:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fellow&rsquo;s mad,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Always was;
but, since he&rsquo;s joined the proletariats in America, he&rsquo;s
stark, staring mad. He was so jolly yesterday, coming with that old
sewing-machine. He is a good sort, there&rsquo;s something nice about
him. But he&rsquo;s quite mad. Vreeswijck is much better company. We
won&rsquo;t ask him again: what do you say, Constance? The
fellow&rsquo;s really mad; and, besides, he doesn&rsquo;t know how to
talk and, when all is said, he was impertinent, with his &lsquo;titled
capitalists.&rsquo; Indeed, I ought really to apologize to you for
asking such a queer fish to your house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is different from other people,&rdquo; she said,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb87" href="#pb87" name=
"pb87">87</a>]</span>&ldquo;but I think that, however much he may
differ from you, he likes you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her husband burst out irritably:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You women,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;are simply impossible!
Who would ever have thought that you could have found a word of excuse
for Brauws! Why, I was afraid that you would cover me with reproaches
and point out to me that, even though we see nobody, you wouldn&rsquo;t
want to receive a socialist friend of mine. But there&rsquo;s no
understanding women!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was dissatisfied, out of temper, because of Brauws and that
spasmodic conversation; and his tone seemed to invite a scene. But
Constance raised her eyes to his very calmly and said, so gently and
quietly that the voice did not sound like hers to his ears:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Henri, your friend Brauws is a man and an exceptional man;
and that is enough to captivate a woman for a moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you can ask him every day, for all I care.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t ask him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I did, of course!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let us quarrel, Henri. Mr. Brauws asked himself.
But, if you would rather not see any more of him, we won&rsquo;t

accord&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb88" href=

<p>Her gentle words, which he did not understand, disturbed him
greatly; and he went upstairs in a temper, undressed angrily and flung
himself on his bed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, upon my word, he&rsquo;d be upsetting Addie&rsquo;s head
next, with those queer notions,&rdquo; he muttered, as he dug his ear
viciously into his pillow. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb89" href=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A few days had passed, when Brauws rang at the door,
late one afternoon. Constance was sitting in the drawing-room and saw
him through the corner window; and, as she heard the bell, she felt a
shock of alarm. She was afraid, she did not know why, and listened
anxiously to his deep voice in the passage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is meneer at home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps mevrouw is at home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, mevrouw is in. I&rsquo;ll just
ask&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Truitje entered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Brauws, ma&rsquo;am&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Show meneer in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She still felt her heart beating with that strange, inexplicable
shock of alarm. And she thought that it was because she was alone with
that strange man, who had been a workman in America and who could say
such rude things sometimes, suddenly.</p>
<p>They shook hands:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Henri is out,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But sit down. I see in
the paper that you are speaking at Arnhem to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, mevrouw, but I haven&rsquo;t come to talk about
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb90" href="#pb90" name=
"pb90">90</a>]</span>my lectures. I&rsquo;ve come to make you my very
humble apologies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mevrouw, I&rsquo;m a bear. I don&rsquo;t know how to talk to
people. Forgive me &hellip; for what I said the other day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what did you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing&mdash;after your friendly encouragement&mdash;but
what was rude.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no great reverence for titles,&rdquo; she said,
quickly.</p>
<p>She said it so suddenly and spontaneously that it surprised even
herself; and she asked herself, the next second:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do I say that? And is it true, now? Or is it not
true?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She herself did not know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t, perhaps, but Hans has&#8202;&hellip;. But
I was rude especially because, after you had asked me so kindly and
graciously, I still would not talk about my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you were to do that when we knew each other
better&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;People never know each other well.
Still&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&#8202;&hellip;. May I tell you something
about myself from time to time? Perhaps it won&rsquo;t interest you as
much as, from politeness, you wish me to think; but &hellip; when
I&rsquo;ve done it &hellip; I <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb91" href=
"#pb91" name="pb91">91</a>]</span>shall feel relieved&#8202;&hellip;.
Heavens, how difficult words are!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet you are accustomed to speak for
hours!&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a different thing. Then some one else is
speaking inside me. When I myself am speaking, in everyday life, I find
words difficult.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then don&rsquo;t make the least effort, but tell me &hellip;
gradually.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did Addie think? I should like to know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was disappointed, but he did not say much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a serious boy, isn&rsquo;t he? Tell me about
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She felt no more fear and talked about Addie. Brauws laughed, gently
and kindly, at the pride that kept shining from her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was a serious child too,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>And she understood that he was making an effort, in order to talk
about himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was a strange child. Behind our house was a pine-forest,
with hills in it; and behind that a little stream. I used to wander all
day long in those woods, over the hills and beside the stream. They
would miss me at home and look for me and find me there. But gradually
they stopped being frightened, because they understood that I was only
playing. I used to play by myself: a lonely, serious child. It&rsquo;s
true I played at highwaymen and pirates; and yet my games were very
serious, not like a child&rsquo;s <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb92"
href="#pb92" name="pb92">92</a>]</span>&hellip; I still feel a thrill
when I think of that strange childhood of mine&#8202;&hellip;. I used
to play there in those woods and beside that stream, in Holland; but
sometimes I imagined that I was playing at pirates and highwaymen in
America, or in the tropics. And in my childish imagination the whole
Dutch landscape changed. It became a roaring river, with great
boulders, from which the water fell foaming, and very dense, tropical
foliage, such as I had seen in pictures; and great flowers, red and
white, grew in the enormous trees. Then my fancy changed and I was no
longer a pirate or robber, but became &hellip; an oriental prince. I
don&rsquo;t know why I, a pure-bred Dutch boy, should have had that
strange vision of the east, of something tropical, there, on those
pine-covered hills and beside that little stream&#8202;&hellip;. It was
always like that afterwards: the tropical landscape, the spreading
cocoa-trees, the broad plantain-leaves and the huge flowers, white and
red &hellip; and then I often thought, &lsquo;Now I will find
her.&rsquo; Whom I wanted to find I didn&rsquo;t know; but I would run
down the hills and roam beside the little river and seek and seek
&hellip; and my seeking for &lsquo;her&rsquo; became strange and
fantastic: I, an oriental, was seeking for a fairy, or a princess, I
forget which. It seemed to me as if she were running there ahead of me,
very white and fragile: a little child, as I was a child; a girl, as I
was a boy; in white and decked with the flowers, white and red
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb93" href="#pb93" name=
"pb93">93</a>]</span>&hellip; And my seeking for the princess, for the
fairy, for the little white, fragile girl became so intense that I
sometimes thought I had found her, found her in my imagination; and
then I would speak to her, as in a dream&#8202;&hellip;. Until &hellip;
until I woke from my waking dream and remembered that I had been
wandering away from home for hours, that my mother would be anxious,
that I was not fit to be seen, that I looked like a dirty street-boy,
that I had only been dreaming, that there were no white or red flowers
around me &hellip; and then I would cry, boy of thirteen though I was,
passionately, as if I should go mad&#8202;&hellip;. And I have never
told all this to any one, but I am telling it to you, because I want to
ask you: Addie is not like that, is he? When you come to think of it,
how children differ, at that age!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She sat on her chair, very pale, and could not speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My parents did not know that I was like that; and I told
nobody about my fancies. I went to school, in the meantime, and was
just the usual sort of schoolboy. I was cruel to animals, a vulgar
little rascal, in the meantime; and it was only in those free hours
that I wandered and dreamt. And, when I now look at your boy, who is
like a little man, I sometimes think, how is it possible that he is
like this and that I was like that, at the same age?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She made an effort to smile. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb94"
href="#pb94" name="pb94">94</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;So you see,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;<i>gradually</i> perhaps I
shall be able to tell you something about my life &hellip; at least, if
it interests you&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It seemed as if his first confession had in fact given him a greater
facility, for of his own accord he now went on talking: how, when he
grew a year or two older, he had shaken those fancies from him as so
much child&rsquo;s-play and devoted himself seriously to every kind of
study, until he went to the university, where he not only read law, but
really took up all the other faculties in between, while at the same
time he felt attracted by every branch of knowledge:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was a ready learner and a quick reader; I remembered
everything; and I had a sort of fever to know everything in the world,
to know all there was to know and learn. That I afterwards went and
travelled goes almost without saying. And
then&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was at this moment that Van der Welcke entered. He was at first
surprised, almost annoyed to see Brauws; but his warm friendship gained
the upper hand:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo, anarchist!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Is that
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But it was very late; Addie came in; it was close upon dinner-time.
Brauws said good-bye and promised to come again and fetch Van der
Welcke in a &ldquo;machine;&rdquo; and that made up for everything to
Van der Welcke. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb95" href="#pb95" name=

<h2 class="main">Chapter XII</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It was a howling winter night of storm and rain. Addie
was doing his lessons after dinner; and Van der Welcke had gone to sit
by him with a book &ldquo;because there was such a draught in his
room.&rdquo; Constance was all alone. And she loved the loneliness of
it just then. She had taken up a book, a piece of needlework; but first
one and then the other had slipped from her hands. And, in the soft
light of the lace-shaded lamps, she lay back in her chair and listened
to the melancholy storm outside, which seemed to be rushing past the
house like some monstrous animal. She was in a mood of vague
excitement, of mingled nervousness and depression; and, in her
loneliness, she let this strange feeling take possession of her and
gave herself up to the quite new luxury of thinking about herself,
wondering dimly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does that sort of thing really exist?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She found no answer to her question; she heard only the storm raging
outside, the hiss of its lash round the groaning trees; and those
mournful voices of the night did not include the mystic voice which
alone could have supplied the answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does that sort of thing really exist?&rdquo; she asked
herself again.</p>
<p>And, in that vague emotion, she was conscious of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb96" href="#pb96" name="pb96">96</a>]</span>a sense
of fear, of a rising anxiety, an increasing terror. When, after a lull,
the storm burst into sudden fury again, she started violently, as she
had started when Brauws&rsquo; hand rang the bell&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>With each shriller howl of the raging storm she started; and each
fresh alarm left her so nervous and so strangely despondent that she
could not understand herself&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does that sort of thing really exist then?&rdquo; she asked
herself for the third time.</p>
<p>And the question seemed each time to echo through her soul like a
refrain. She could never have thought, suspected or imagined that such
things really existed. She did not remember ever reading about them or
ever talking to anybody about them. It had never been her nature to
attach much importance to the strange coincidences of life, because
they had never harmonized in her life with those of other lives; at
least, she did not know about them, did not remember
them&#8202;&hellip;. For a moment, it flashed through her mind that she
had walked as the blind walk, all her life, in a pitch-dark night
&hellip; and that to-day suddenly a light had shone out before her and
a ruddy glow had filtered through her closed eyelids.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;in those things I have always
been very much of a woman; and I have never thought about them. If by
chance I ever heard about them, they did not attract me. Then why do
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb97" href="#pb97" name=
"pb97">97</a>]</span>they strike me so forcibly now? And why do I feel
so strange?&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wind suddenly cried aloud, like the martyred soul of some
monster; and she started, but forced herself to concentrate her
thoughts:</p>
<p>&ldquo;He can&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;What can he
know, to make him speak deliberately &hellip; of those childish years?
No, he can&rsquo;t know; and I felt that he did not know, that he was
only speaking in order to compare himself with Addie to Addie&rsquo;s
mother, in a burst of confidence. He is a man of impulses, I
think&#8202;&hellip;. No, there was nothing at the back of his words
&hellip; and he knows nothing, nothing of my own early
years&#8202;&hellip;. We are almost the same age: he is four years
older than Henri. When he was a child, I was a child. When he was
dreaming, I was dreaming. Does that sort of thing really exist? Or is
it my fancy, some unconscious vein of poetry inside me, that is making
me imagine all this?&hellip; Hush, hush &hellip; it is becoming absurd!
It is all very pretty and charming in children: they can have their
day-dreams; and a young man and a young girl might perhaps give a
thought to them afterwards, in a romantic moment; but, at my age, it
all becomes absurd, utterly absurd&#8202;&hellip;. And of course
it&rsquo;s <i>not</i> there: it&rsquo;s nothing but a chance
coincidence. I won&rsquo;t think about it any more&#8202;&hellip;. And
yet &hellip; I have never felt before as I do now. Oh, that feeling as
if I had always been straying, blindly, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb98" href="#pb98" name="pb98">98</a>]</span>with my eyes shut, in a
dark night! Have I never had that feeling before, that feeling as if
nothing had really existed, as if I had never lived yet, as if I wanted
to live once, just once, in my life?&hellip; But no, it can never be
like that, it can&rsquo;t happen like that. No, that sort of thing does
not exist. It is just our imagination when we are feeling restless and
dissatisfied &hellip; or when we are tired and feel that we have no
energy &hellip; or whatever it is that makes us more easily affected by
all those strange things which we never suspected&#8202;&hellip;. Why
did I not at once laugh and say that, as a child, as a little girl, I
myself&#8202;&hellip;? No, no, I simply couldn&rsquo;t say it; and it
is better that I didn&rsquo;t say it&#8202;&hellip;. Now I am getting
frightened at my own silliness. It is all very well for young people,
for a boy and a girl, to have these fancies and even talk of them, in a
romantic moment, but at my age it is simply ridiculous&#8202;&hellip;.
It is so long ago, so long ago; and, with all those years in between,
it would be ridiculous to refer to poetic dreams and fancies which can
only be spoken of when one is very young&#8202;&hellip;. I
sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t speak of them &hellip; and I shall never tell him.
Wouldn&rsquo;t it be &hellip; utterly ridiculous?&hellip; Yet it does
seem &hellip; it does seem to me that, after those years&mdash;when, as
Gerrit said, I was a dear little child, playing in the river at
Buitenzorg, making up stories about fairies and
<i>poetries</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2230src" href="#xd26e2230"
name="xd26e2230src">1</a> decked with <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb99" href="#pb99" name="pb99">99</a>]</span>flowers, red and
white&mdash;that, after those years, I lost something of myself,
something romantic that was <i>in</i> me then, something living that
was <i>in</i> me then, and that, since then, I have <i>never</i> lived,
never lived a single moment, as if all sorts of vain and worldly things
had blinded me&#8202;&hellip;. Oh, what thoughts are these and why do I
have them? I won&rsquo;t think them; and yet &hellip; and yet, after
those wonderful, fairy years, it was all over &hellip; all
over&#8202;&hellip;. What do I remember of the years after? Dances,
balls, society, vanity and artificiality&#8202;&hellip;. Yes, it was
all over by then&#8202;&hellip;. And now surely that childish spark
hasn&rsquo;t revived, surely my soul isn&rsquo;t trying, isn&rsquo;t
wanting to live again? No, no, it can&rsquo;t do that: the years are
lying all around it, the silent, dead years of vanity, of blundering,
of longing, of death in life&#8202;&hellip;. And besides, if my soul
did want to live again, it would be too late now, for everything; and
it doesn&rsquo;t want to either&#8202;&hellip;. It&rsquo;s only because
of those strange coincidences, it&rsquo;s only because he spoke like
that &hellip; and because his voice it attractive &hellip; and because
I am sitting here alone &hellip; and because the storm is blowing so
terribly, as though it wanted to open the windows and come
inside&#8202;&hellip;. No, hush, hush &hellip; I won&rsquo;t give way
to those thoughts again, never again &hellip; and, even if that sort of
thing does really exist, it is only for those who are young and who see
life with the glamour of youth &hellip; and not for me, not for me.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb100" href="#pb100" name=
"pb100">100</a>]</span>&hellip; Oh, I couldn&rsquo;t have told him
about myself when I was a child, for it would have appeared to me as
if, by telling him, I was behaving like &hellip; a woman offering
herself!&hellip; But hush, hush: all this is absurd &hellip; for me
&hellip; now; and I will stop thinking of it&#8202;&hellip;. But how
lonely I am, sitting here &hellip; and how the wind howls, how the wind
howls!&hellip; The lamps are flickering; and it&rsquo;s just as if
hands were rattling the shutters, trying hard to open
them&#8202;&hellip;. Oh, I wish those lamps wouldn&rsquo;t flicker
so!&hellip; And I feel as if the windows were going to burst open and
the curtains fly up in the air&#8202;&hellip;. I&rsquo;m
frightened&#8202;&hellip;. Hark to the trees cracking and the branches
falling&#8202;&hellip;. Hear me, O God, hear me! I&rsquo;m frightened,
I&rsquo;m frightened&#8202;&hellip;. Is this then the first night that
I see something of myself, as if I were suddenly looking back, on a
dark path that lies behind me, a dark path on which all the pageant of
vanity has grown dim? For it does seem as if, right at the end of the
road, I saw, as in a vision, the sun; trees with great leaves and
blossoms red and white; and a little fairy child, in white, with
flowers in her hair, standing on a boulder, in a river, beckoning
mysteriously to her brothers, who do not understand. O my God, does
that sort of thing really, really exist &hellip; or is it only because
I never, never heard the wind blow like this before?&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>These thoughts, these doubts, these wonderings <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb101" href="#pb101" name=
"pb101">101</a>]</span>flashed through her; and, because she had never
heard herself thinking and doubting and wondering so swiftly, she grew
still more frightened in her loneliness, while the storm howled more
furiously outside. And the silent lamps flickered so violently in her
drawing-room&mdash;in a sort of passionate draught&mdash;that she
suddenly rushed staggering to the door. She went up the stairs; and it
was as though the storm would break the little villa to pieces with one
blow of its angry wing&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>She went to Addie&rsquo;s room; her hand was on the door-handle; she
turned it. She saw her boy working at his table and Van der Welcke
smoking in the easy-chair. She gave a start, because he was there, and
she looked deathly pale, with terrified, quivering eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mamma!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My boy, I&rsquo;m frightened; listen to the
storm!&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, did you ever see such weather?&rdquo; asked Van der
Welcke, through the clouds of his cigarette.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you frightened, Mamma?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, my boy, my Addie &hellip; I&rsquo;m frightened &hellip;
I&rsquo;m frightened&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And shall your boy keep you safe, safe from the
wind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, my darling, keep me safe!&rdquo; she said, with a wan
little laugh. &ldquo;For I&rsquo;m really, really frightened &hellip;
I&rsquo;ve been sitting alone downstairs &hellip; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb102" href="#pb102" name="pb102">102</a>]</span>and
it blew so, it blew so: the lamps blew and the shutters banged and
I&rsquo;m so frightened now!&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy drew her on his knees and held her very tight:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silly Mummy! Are you really frightened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She made herself very small in his arms, between his knees, nestled
up against him and repeated, as in a dream:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m so frightened, I&rsquo;m so
frightened!&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>And, without a further glance at her husband sitting there clouded
in the blue smoke of his cigarette, she as it were crept into the heart
of her child, whispering, all pale and wan, with a wan smile and her
eyes full of anxious wonder:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m frightened, Addie! Save me! Protect
me!&hellip;&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb103" href="#pb103"

<p class="first">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m mad!&rdquo; he thought, as, after a
hasty meal at a restaurant in the town, he walked along the Hooge Weg
to Scheveningen through the shrieking winter night.</p>
<p>The leafless branches lashed tragically to and fro, as though
sweeping the scudding clouds; and the street-lamps seemed like ghostly
eyes blinking here and there in the fitful darkness&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m mad! Why did I tell her all that, I &hellip; I who
can never talk to women?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was walking against the wind, angry with himself and angry with
the wind when it barred his way with its widespread hindering arms. The
wind whistled very high in the air, along the topmost leafless boughs;
and the boughs broke off, as though at the touch of angry fingers, and
scattered all around him; and sometimes a heavier branch fell, black,
right at his feet. He walked on&mdash;his legs were stronger than the
wind barring his way, tugging at his flapping coat&mdash;walked with
his hands in his pockets, his collar turned up, his hat pulled over his
eyes; and he walked on and on without an object, only with an eager
craving for the sea, for sea and air and wind, to blow and wash
everything out of his brain, which otherwise would be sick with
dreaming&#8202;&hellip;. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb104" href=
"#pb104" name="pb104">104</a>]</span>Was he still such a dreamer, even
though all the rest of his life belied his dreams? What did he mean by
suddenly going to that woman, apologizing to her that afternoon because
he didn&rsquo;t know how to talk and then suddenly talking, talking
like a boy, telling her things&mdash;shadowy things of the
past&mdash;which he had never told to anybody, because they were not
things to be told, because, once told, they ceased to exist?&hellip;
What interest did she take in his childish games and his childish
dreams?&hellip; He had probably bored her: perhaps she had laughed at
him&mdash;the cynical little laugh of the society-woman&mdash;and at
his really too-ridiculous simplicity, the simplicity of a man who had
thought and worked and lived and who had yet always remained a child
&hellip; in certain little corners of his soul&#8202;&hellip;. He was
so much ashamed at the recollection of all that he had dared to say to
her, so much ashamed of the irresistible impulse which had driven him
to speak to her, at such length, of his childhood and his childish
imaginings, that he was now&mdash;as though to regain mastery of
himself after the strange spell of her presence&mdash;that he was now
fighting with the wind, to make himself feel strong again and a
man&#8202;&hellip;. The wind clung howling to his body, dragged itself
by his legs, struck him blinding blows in the face, but he walked on:
his strong legs walked on, with a sharp, regular step, ever mightier
than the wind, which he trod under foot and kicked out of his
path&#8202;&hellip;. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb105" href="#pb105"
name="pb105">105</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what it was,&rdquo; he thought,
&ldquo;but, once I was alone with her, I had &hellip; I <i>had</i> to
say it&#8202;&hellip;. How can I be of <i>any</i> use in the world,
when I am such a dreamer?&hellip; Women! Have women ever woven into my
life anything beyond the most commonplace threads? Have I ever confided
in a woman before, or felt that irresistible impulse to open my heart,
as I did this afternoon, in that weak moment of enchantment? Why to
her, why to her? Why not to others, before her, and why first to
her?&hellip; Must my life always be this clumsy groping with dreams on
one side and facts on the other? But why, why should I have spoken like
that: what was the overpowering impulse that made me tell her those
strange things, that made it impossible for me to do anything else? Are
our actions then so independent of ourselves that we just behave
according to the laws of the most secret forces in and above
us?&hellip; Do <i>I</i> know what it was in me that made me speak like
that, that compelled me to speak like that? It was like an irresistible
temptation, it was like a path that sloped down to delectable valleys
and it was as if angels or demons&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know
which&mdash;pushed and pushed me and whispered, &lsquo;Tell it all
&hellip; and go down the path&#8202;&hellip;. You&rsquo;ll see how
beautiful it is, you&rsquo;ll see how beautiful it becomes!&rsquo; She
&hellip; just listened, without speaking, without moving. What did she
think? Nothing, most likely. She heard nothing, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb106" href="#pb106" name="pb106">106</a>]</span>she
felt nothing. If she&rsquo;s thinking of me now, she thinks of me as a
madman, or at least a crank&#8202;&hellip;. What is she? She has been a
woman of the world, of just that world which I hate&#8202;&hellip;.
What has her life been? She married a man much older than herself, out
of vanity. Then a moment of passion, between her and
Hans&#8202;&hellip;. What else has there been, what else is there in
her? Nothing! How utterly small they all are, these people who
don&rsquo;t think, who don&rsquo;t live: who exist like dolls, with
dolls&rsquo; brains and dolls&rsquo; souls, in a dolls&rsquo; world!
What am I doing among them? Oh, not that I&rsquo;m big; not that I am
worth more than they, but, if I am to do anything&mdash;for the
world&mdash;I must live among real people, different people from them
&hellip; or I must live alone, wrapped in myself!&hellip; That has
always been the everlasting seesaw: doing, dreaming, doing,
dreaming&#8202;&hellip;. But there has never been that temptation, that
beckoning towards delectable valleys of oblivion and that luxury of
allowing myself to be drawn along as though by soul-magnetism, by the
strange sympathy of a woman&rsquo;s soul!&hellip; Is it then so, in
reality! Is it merely a mirage of love? Love has never come into my
life: have I ever known what it was? Is there <i>one</i> woman then,
only one? Can we find, even late, like this?&hellip; Oh, I wish that
this wind would blow all this uncertainty, all these vapourings out of
my head and my heart &hellip; and leave me strong and simple &hellip;
to act alone, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb107" href="#pb107" name=
"pb107">107</a>]</span>to act alone!&hellip; And now I will <i>not</i>
think about it any more&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he quickened his pace and fought more vigorously against the
wind, with a wrestler&rsquo;s vigour, and, when at last he saw the sea,
foaming pale under the black pall of cloud and roaring with a thousand
voices, he thought:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It all came from one moment of foolishness. It had no real
existence. I spoke as I should not have spoken, but what I said was
nothing and is being blown out of my heart and out of my head at this
very moment&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But, the next day, waking from a calm sleep, he asked himself:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it not just the unutterable things in us that matter more
than anything else to us &hellip; and to those who made us divine
them?&hellip;&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb108" href="#pb108"

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A day or two later, Marianne called:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Auntie,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen you for
days. What&rsquo;s the matter? Are you vexed with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, no, Marianne.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, there&rsquo;s something. You&rsquo;re cross with me.
Tell me that you&rsquo;re not cross with me. I haven&rsquo;t dined with
you for an age. You are vexed with me because I invited myself. Tell me
that I&rsquo;m mistaken, that you&rsquo;re not vexed with me. And do
ask me to dinner again, one day&#8202;&hellip;. It&rsquo;s such a busy
time just now: parties, dinners, the Court ball the other night. It was
very boring&#8202;&hellip;. We never see you. You never call on us. Nor
Uncle either. It&rsquo;s all through that Brauws man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Constance started, with that strange nervous catch in her
throat:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That old friend of Uncle&rsquo;s, who speaks on Peace.
I&rsquo;ve heard him: it was splendid, splendid. His speech was
topping, I&rsquo;m mad on Peace. But he takes possession of Uncle; the
boys have seen them together twice, in a motor-car. It&rsquo;s all
through Brauws that I never see anything of either of
you&#8202;&hellip;. I suppose he&rsquo;s been to dinner,
too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb109" href=
"#pb109" name="pb109">109</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m jealous, Auntie. Why should he come when you
don&rsquo;t ask me? Doesn&rsquo;t Mr. Van Vreeswijck ever come now
either? If you&rsquo;re angry with me, I&rsquo;ll be an angel in the
future, I&rsquo;ll never invite myself again. But do invite me again,
yourself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, you silly child, I&rsquo;m not angry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you are; you&rsquo;re cross with me. You&rsquo;re not
the same. You&rsquo;re different towards me. I feel it. I see
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Marianne&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you? Am I wrong?&hellip;. Tell me that
you&rsquo;re not cross with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She knelt down by Constance, caressingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marianne, what a baby you are!&hellip; I am not cross:
there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say it once more, like a darling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;am&mdash;not&mdash;cross. There: are you
satisfied?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I believe you now. And when am I coming to
dinner?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You little tyrant!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I daren&rsquo;t ask myself again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you like so much in our dinners?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re just what I do like. The other night, when I
was so bored at the Court ball, I thought, &lsquo;So long as Auntie
asks me again soon, I don&rsquo;t mind
anything!&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rubbish! I don&rsquo;t believe a word of it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite true.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb110" href="#pb110" name="pb110">110</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, will you come one evening &hellip; with Brauws and Van
Vreeswijck? Then I&rsquo;ll ask Uncle Gerrit and Aunt Adeline
too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather! That will be lovely. When?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll write and let you know; don&rsquo;t be so
impatient.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you <i>are</i> a darling!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She hugged her aunt:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re looking so nice to-day, Auntie. So pretty. You
are really. I say, how old are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You silly child, what does it matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to know. Wait, I can work it out. Mamma said there was
eight years between you. Mamma is fifty. So you must be
forty-two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very nearly forty-three. That&rsquo;s old, isn&rsquo;t
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old? I don&rsquo;t know. For some women. Not for you.
You&rsquo;re young. And how young Uncle looks, doesn&rsquo;t he? Why,
Addie is more sedate than Uncle!&hellip; You don&rsquo;t look
forty-two, you look ten years less than that. Auntie, isn&rsquo;t it
strange how the years go by? I &hellip; I feel old. One year comes
after another; and it all makes me miserable&#8202;&hellip;. Auntie,
tell me, what makes me so fond of you?&hellip; Sometimes &hellip;
sometimes I feel as if I could cry when I am
here&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do I make you so sad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not that. But, when I&rsquo;m with you, I don&rsquo;t
know why, I&rsquo;m always thinking &hellip; even when I&rsquo;m
chattering &hellip; I feel happy in your house, Auntie. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb111" href="#pb111" name=
"pb111">111</a>]</span>Look, here are the tears!&hellip; But you
&hellip; you have tears in your eyes also. Yes, you have, you
can&rsquo;t deny it. Tell me, Auntie, what is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Marianne, it&rsquo;s nothing &hellip; but you talk such
nonsense sometimes &hellip; and that upsets me; and, when I see other
people crying, it makes the tears come into my eyes too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle isn&rsquo;t always nice to you, is he,
Auntie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Marianne!&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I know he isn&rsquo;t. Do let me talk about it.
It&rsquo;s so horrid, when you&rsquo;re very fond of some one, always
to be silent about the things you&rsquo;re thinking of. Let me talk
about it. I know that Uncle is not always nice. I told him the other
day&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be angry when you hear. I told him the other day
that he must be nicer to you. Are you angry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, dear, but&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you mustn&rsquo;t be angry: I meant to say the right
thing. I can&rsquo;t bear to think of your not being happy together. Do
try and be happy together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Marianne dear, it&rsquo;s years
now&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but it must be altered. Auntie, it <i>must</i> be
altered. It would make me so awfully happy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Marianne, Marianne, how excitable you
are!&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I feel for people when I&rsquo;m fond of them. There
are people who never feel and others <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb112" href="#pb112" name="pb112">112</a>]</span>who never speak out.
I feel &hellip; and I say what I think. I&rsquo;m like that.
Mamma&rsquo;s different: she never speaks out. I must speak out; I
should choke if I didn&rsquo;t. I should like to say everything,
always. When I&rsquo;m miserable, I want to say so; when I feel happy,
I want to say so. But it&rsquo;s not always possible,
Auntie&#8202;&hellip;. Auntie, do try and be happy with Uncle. He is so
nice, he is so kind; and you <i>were</i> very fond of him once.
It&rsquo;s a very long time ago, I know; but you must begin and grow
fond of each other again. Tell me, can&rsquo;t you love him any
more?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I see it all: you can&rsquo;t! No, you can&rsquo;t love
him any more. And Uncle <i>is</i> so nice, so kind &hellip; even though
he is so quick-tempered and excitable. He&rsquo;s so young still:
he&rsquo;s just like a hot-headed undergraduate sometimes, Henri said.
In that scene with Papa, he was just like a game-cock&#8202;&hellip;.
You know, in the family, the uncles are afraid of Uncle Henri, because
he always wants to be fighting duels. But that&rsquo;s his quick
temper; in reality, he&rsquo;s nice, he&rsquo;s kind. I know it,
Auntie, because, when Uncle sees me home, we talk about all sorts of
things, tell each other everything. You don&rsquo;t mind, Auntie, do
you? You&rsquo;re not jealous?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you&rsquo;re not jealous. And Uncle Henri is my uncle
too, isn&rsquo;t he, and there&rsquo;s no harm in talking <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb113" href="#pb113" name="pb113">113</a>]</span>to
him? He talks so nicely: time seems to fly when Uncle&rsquo;s
talking&#8202;&hellip;. Tell me, Auntie, Brauws: is Brauws really a
gentleman? He has been a workman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but that was because he wanted to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand those queer men, do you? No, you
don&rsquo;t either, you can&rsquo;t understand such a queer man any
more than I can. Just imagine &hellip; Uncle Henri as a labouring man!
Can you imagine it? No, no, not possibly! He speaks well, Brauws; and I
raved about Peace for a whole evening&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And since?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. I don&rsquo;t rave over things long. Raving isn&rsquo;t
the same as feeling. When I really feel&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then&mdash;I think&mdash;it is for always. For
always.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Marianne, darling, you mustn&rsquo;t be so
sentimental!&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what about you? You&rsquo;re crying
again&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Marianne.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you&rsquo;re crying. Let&rsquo;s cry together, Auntie. I
feel as if I want to cry with you; I&rsquo;m in that sort of mood, I
don&rsquo;t know why. There, see, I <i>am</i>
crying!&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She knelt down by Constance; and her tears really came. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb114" href="#pb114" name="pb114">114</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear, you mustn&rsquo;t excite yourself like that. Some one
is coming; I hear Uncle&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl recovered herself quickly as Van der Welcke entered the
room. He stood for a moment in the doorway, smiling his gay, boyish
smile, his blue eyes glowing with happiness. She looked at him for a
second.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Marianne &hellip; I haven&rsquo;t seen you for ever so
long&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you&rsquo;re always in that old car with
Brauws&#8202;&hellip;. And I&rsquo;ve been an absolute butterfly. Only
think, at the Court ball, the other night, just as the Queen entered
the ball-room&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She sat down and told her little budget of news in a voice that
seemed to come from far away. The dusk crept in and shadowed the room,
obliterating their outlines and the expression of their faces.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t she coming?&rdquo; asked Adolphine,
with a sidelong glance at the door.</p>
<p>It was Sunday evening, at Mamma van Lowe&rsquo;s, and it was after
half-past nine. It had been like that every Sunday evening since
Constance returned from Nice: the sidelong, almost anxious look towards
the door; the almost anxious question:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is she coming?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if she did to-night,&rdquo;
said Floortje. &ldquo;If so, she&rsquo;s coming late, so as not to stay
long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mother and daughter were sitting at the bridge-table with Uncle
Ruyvenaer and Jaap; and the cards fell slackly one upon the other,
uninterestingly, with a dull flop; and Floortje gathered in the tricks
mechanically, silently and greedily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a frump Cateau looks to-night!&rdquo; said Adolphine,
with a furtive glance at the second card-table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like a washerwoman in satin,&rdquo; said Floortje.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say,&rdquo; said Uncle Ruyvenaer, burning to say something
spiteful: he was losing, couldn&rsquo;t get a hand, kept throwing his
low cards, furiously, one after the other, on Floortje&rsquo;s fat
trumps. &ldquo;I say, it&rsquo;s high time Bertha interfered!&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb116" href="#pb116" name=
"pb116">116</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, what are you talking about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What am I talking about? What everybody&rsquo;s talking
about: that Marianne is running after Van der Welcke in the most
barefaced fashion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aunt Bertha had better be very careful, with such a rotten
cad as Uncle van der Welcke,&rdquo; Floortje opined.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I passed them the other evening on the
Koninginnegracht,&rdquo; said Jaap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what were they doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How were they walking?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They had hold of each other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he had his arm around her waist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you see it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Did</i> I see it? And he kept on spooning her all the
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Bertha,&rdquo; said Adolphine, &ldquo;who just acts as if
she saw nothing&#8202;&hellip;. Good heavens, what a frump Cateau looks
to-night!&hellip; She doesn&rsquo;t seem to be coming, does
she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, she doesn&rsquo;t seem to be coming now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How does Mamma take it, her staying away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mamma seems to get on without her,&rdquo; answered Uncle
Ruyvenaer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mamma can&rsquo;t really be fond of her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or else Granny would insist on her coming,&rdquo; said
Floortje.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s much quieter, now that she&rsquo;s staying
away.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb117" href="#pb117" name=
"pb117">117</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t mind a bit of a kick-up,&rdquo; said
Jaap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you had to-day&rsquo;s <i>Dwarskijker</i>,
Jaap?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but they&rsquo;ve stopped putting in anything about
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s really a piece of cheek on her part, not to come
any more on Sundays&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And to go rushing off to Nice&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And not even arrange to be back on New Year&rsquo;s
Eve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; and then we hear about &lsquo;longing for the
family.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And even on New Year&rsquo;s Eve&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She takes good care to keep away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Adolphine sentimentally, &ldquo;on New
Year&rsquo;s Eve we ought all to be here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just so,&rdquo; said Uncle Ruyvenaer. &ldquo;I
agree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, if you&rsquo;ve had a
quarrel&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You make it up again&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And start quarrelling again, with renewed courage, on the
first of January,&rdquo; grinned Jaap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;I&rsquo;ve always said so&mdash;what Constance has
not got is &hellip; a heart,&rdquo; Adolphine continued,
pathetically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know what I think?&rdquo; said Floortje, sinking her
voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That she encourages Marianne.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, deliberately.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb118" href="#pb118" name="pb118">118</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;But what for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, to be free of her husband.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of Van der Welcke?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To get &hellip; rid of him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course. He&rsquo;s young &hellip; and she&rsquo;s
old,&rdquo; said Floortje, not sparing her mother, who was only four
years younger than Constance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But do you believe&#8202;&hellip;?&rdquo; said Uncle, nodding
his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, I don&rsquo;t say that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But still&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I expect it&rsquo;s only just spooning &hellip; as Jaap
says.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <i>don&rsquo;t</i> think!&rdquo; said Jaap, with a knowing
grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Behave yourself, Jaap!&rdquo; said Adolphine, angry because
Floortje had used the word &ldquo;old.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rats!&rdquo; said Jaap, rudely, shrugging his shoulders, as
much as to say that Mamma was an idiot. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll eat my hat if
it&rsquo;s only spooning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They looked at one another: Uncle, Adolphine and Floortje.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t speak like that,&rdquo; said Adolphine, in
a tone of reprimand, &ldquo;when you don&rsquo;t
know&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what does Floortje know and what do you know? And you are
both just as bad as I am, with your insinuations&#8202;&hellip;. Only,
I <i>say</i> what you and Floortje <i>think</i>&hellip;.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb119" href="#pb119" name=
"pb119">119</a>]</span></p>
<p>He flung down his cards and left his seat, because he couldn&rsquo;t
stand being treated like a little boy who didn&rsquo;t know things.</p>
<p>The three others went on talking about Marianne and Van der Welcke
&hellip; because they saw. But they saw nothing of Brauws and Constance
&hellip; and did not talk about them&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, <i>dear</i>!&rdquo; whined Cateau. &ldquo;What a
<i>frump</i> Aunt Adolph-ine looks to-night!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was sitting at the bridge-table with Aunt Ruyvenaer, Toetie and
Eduard van Raven and looked over her ample bust at each card as she
played it, very carefully, putting it down with her fat, stumpy
fingers, the incarnation of unctuous caution.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-night?&rdquo; asked Eduard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, so oft-en: such a frump!&rdquo; declared Cateau,
emphatically. &ldquo;So dowd-y!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s your husband&rsquo;s sister, after all,&rdquo;
said Aunt Ruyvenaer, quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Aunt-ie, I <i>know</i>&hellip;. But Ka-rel is al-ways a
gen-tleman!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Aunt Adolphine never,&rdquo; replied Van Raven, to
provoke her.</p>
<p>There was no love lost between aunt and nephew; and Cateau said,
meekly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m not say-ing it to say any-thing
un-<i>kind</i> about Adolph-ine&#8202;&hellip;. But, Van Ra-ven, how
<i>ill</i> Emilie-tje&rsquo;s looking: so tired! Are you two all right
to-gether?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb120" href="#pb120"
name="pb120">120</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, <i>half</i> right,&rdquo; said Van Raven, echoing her
emphasis.</p>
<p>Toetie tittered behind her cards; and Auntie said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Ajo</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2700src" href=
"#xd26e2700" name="xd26e2700src">1</a> Edua-r-r-rd, you!&hellip; Attend
to the game&#8202;&hellip;. Your lead!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cateau was no match for Van Raven at laconic repartee and so she
preferred to go on talking about Constance and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is she nev-er com-ing to Mo-ther&rsquo;s Sun-days again? Ah,
I ex-pect she&rsquo;s been fright-ened away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By you?&rdquo; asked Eduard, gleefully capturing
Cateau&rsquo;s knave of trumps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, by the old <i>aunts</i>. It was re-ally ve-ry tactless
&hellip; of the two old <i>aunts</i>&hellip;. Isn&rsquo;t it aw-ful:
about Mari-anne and Van der Wel-cke?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Karel, Van Saetzema and Dijkerhof were playing three-handed bridge
at the third table. They had begun in grim silence, each of them eager
to play the dummy, and inwardly Karel thought his sister Adolphine
dowdy, Van Saetzema thought his sister-in-law Cateau dowdy, while
Dijkerhof thought both his aunts very dowdy, hardly presentable. All
three, however, kept their thoughts locked up in the innermost recesses
of their souls, so that outwardly they were playing very seriously,
their eyes fixed greedily and attentively on the dummy&rsquo;s exposed
cards. Suddenly, however, Karel said: <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb121" href="#pb121" name="pb121">121</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I say&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; asked Van Saetzema.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it caddish of Van der Welcke?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What? Compromising Marianne?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, those girls of Aunt Bertha&rsquo;s!&rdquo; said
Dijkerhof, with a grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; asked his father-in-law.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Louise is in love with her brother Otto, Emilie with
her brother Henri and now Marianne, by way of variety, goes falling in
love with her uncle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re crazy, all that Van Naghel lot,&rdquo; said
Karel, who felt particularly fit and well that evening, puffing
luxuriously after a substantial dinner. &ldquo;I say, what about
Constance? Isn&rsquo;t she coming any more?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t look like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t Aunt Constance coming any more?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it doesn&rsquo;t look like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father, it&rsquo;s my turn to take dummy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Saetzema, it&rsquo;s Dijkerhof&rsquo;s turn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Father-in-law and son-in-law exchanged seats.</p>
<p>The old aunts were sitting in a corner near the door of the
conservatory:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Tine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t seem to be coming any more on
Sundays.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Tine, she doesn&rsquo;t come on Sundays now.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb122" href="#pb122" name=

<p>&ldquo;A good thing too!&rdquo; Tine yelled into Rine&rsquo;s
ear.</p>
<p>Mamma van Lowe, smiling sadly, moved from table to table, with
Dorine, asking the children if they wouldn&rsquo;t like something to
drink. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb123" href="#pb123" name=

<p class="first">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re absolutely humanizing
Brauws,&rdquo; said Van der Welcke to Constance, when Brauws had
accepted a second invitation to dinner. &ldquo;And with other people
coming, too!&hellip; It&rsquo;s incredible!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was fond of seeing people whom she liked at her table; and she
took a pleasure in making her house comfortable for others as well as
for herself. Addie was to come down to dinner. Adeline was going out
for the first time after her recent confinement; and Gerrit was glad to
come, appreciated a good dinner. Her only fear had been that Van
Vreeswijck would think it too much of a family dinner this time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me frankly, would you rather not come?&rdquo; she asked
Van Vreeswijck.</p>
<p>But he almost flushed as he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m delighted to come, mevrouw.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had noticed lately that he was paying great attention to
Marianne; and she was almost glad of it.</p>
<p>They were very gay at dinner; and Brauws, feeling quite at home,
talked about America: how he had stood on the platform of an electric
tram, in wind and rain, as driver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Constance,&rdquo; said Paul, &ldquo;all the social elements
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb124" href="#pb124" name=
"pb124">124</a>]</span>are assembled at your dinner-table to-night! Did
you choose them on purpose? Van Vreeswijck represents the Court
aristocracy; your husband, let us say, the country aristocracy:
it&rsquo;s the only word I can find for him; Gerrit the army; Brauws
labour; I the middle-classes, the pure unadulterated capitalists; and
your boy the future, the mysterious future! The ladies are not so
mixed: next time, you must mix your ladies&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Brauws,&rdquo; Marianne asked, suddenly, &ldquo;why
aren&rsquo;t you driving a tram now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Freule,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2792src" href="#xd26e2792"
name="xd26e2792src">1</a> to explain that, I should have to talk to you
for two hours about myself; and you wouldn&rsquo;t be interested in the
explanation&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes!&rdquo; said Marianne, flippantly. &ldquo;If you had
remained a tram-driver, your life would not have interested me. Now
that you have resigned your rank as a workman and are eating <i lang=
"fr">p&acirc;t&eacute;</i> and drinking champagne with us, it does
interest me. For it&rsquo;s just that evolution which attracts
me&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marianne!&rdquo; said Paul, admonishing her. &ldquo;Not so
fast, child: you&rsquo;re only a little girl and you mustn&rsquo;t
discuss such questions. You&rsquo;ll be making Mr. Brauws afraid to
take another mouthful!&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brauws was obviously a little annoyed; and Constance whispered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marianne &hellip; don&rsquo;t talk like
that&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Auntie&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb125" href="#pb125" name="pb125">125</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;No, dear, don&rsquo;t do it: don&rsquo;t talk like
that&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am I always saying tactless things?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, but &hellip; if you keep on, you&rsquo;ll really make
Brauws refuse to come to the houses of people like
ourselves&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who eat <i lang="fr">p&acirc;t&eacute;</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush, Marianne!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle!&rdquo; said Marianne to Van der Welcke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think it silly? To become a workman and then
leave off? Why? That&rsquo;s what I want to know. If you want to become
one, you should remain one! Are you in sympathy with those ideas which
lead to nothing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very fond of Brauws, Marianne.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But not of his ideas?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he&rsquo;s a monomaniac. He&rsquo;s mad on that point, or
was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just so: was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marianne, are you always so implacable?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bells:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not implacable. Paul is really right: I
mustn&rsquo;t talk like that. I blurt out the first thing that comes
into my head. Is Brauws angry, do you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With you? No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, Uncle, do you think it&rsquo;s the least use, always
thinking about that improvement of social conditions? Why not, all of
us, do good where we can <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb126" href=
"#pb126" name="pb126">126</a>]</span>and, for the rest, try and be
happy ourselves? That&rsquo;s the great thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Van der Welcke laughed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What an easy solution, Marianne!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me, Uncle: do you do a lot of good?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you happy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not always&#8202;&hellip;. I don&rsquo;t do any good either,
or not much. I am happy &hellip; sometimes. You see, I don&rsquo;t go
very far, even according to my own superficial creed. Uncle, are we
very insignificant, should you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who, baby?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You and I! Much more insignificant than Brauws?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are we small?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Small?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, are we small souls &hellip; and is he &hellip; is he a
big one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps, Marianne.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m a small one. And you too &hellip; I think.
He&rsquo;s not. No, he&rsquo;s one of the big ones &hellip; though he
is eating <i lang="fr">p&acirc;t&eacute;</i> just now. But I, a small
soul, shall always like small souls best. I like you much better than
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet he is more interesting than I; and one doesn&rsquo;t
come across many big souls.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb127"
href="#pb127" name="pb127">127</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but I like you best. I daren&rsquo;t talk to him again. I
should start quarrelling with him at once. Straight away. I could never
quarrel with you. That&rsquo;s the sympathy between small soul &hellip;
and small soul. Tell me, is your insignificance attracted to mine
also?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps, Marianne.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You say perhaps to everything. Say yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are we both small?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Both of us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In sympathy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bells:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;yes!&rdquo; she laughed; and the little
bells tinkled merrily, the shrill little silver bells. &ldquo;Uncle, I
drink to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To our small &hellip; sympathy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here goes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Their champagne-glasses touched, with a crystal note. They
drank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you drinking to?&rdquo; asked Paul.</p>
<p>She put her finger to her tiny mouth. She was radiant and, in her
excitement, she became very pretty, with her shining eyes. She felt
that Brauws was looking at her; and she felt that Brauws was still
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb128" href="#pb128" name=
"pb128">128</a>]</span>angry. And, feeling mischievous and happy, with
a desire to tease them all, Brauws, Paul and Van der Welcke, she
murmured, with an airy grace:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s our <i>secret</i>; Uncle&rsquo;s and
mine&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A secret?&rdquo; asked Van Vreeswijck.</p>
<p>She laughed. The bells rang out merrily:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you,&rdquo; she said to Van Vreeswijck, maliciously,
&ldquo;you sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t know the secret ever!&hellip;&rdquo;

<p class="first">The men remained behind to smoke; Constance went to
the drawing-room with Adeline and Marianne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re looking so happy to-night, Aunt
Constance,&rdquo; said Marianne. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think so, Aunt
Adeline? Tell me why.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl herself looked happy, radiant as though with visible rays,
a great light flashing from her sparkling eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Auntie&rsquo;s looking very well,&rdquo; said the simple
little fair-haired woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s because I think it so nice to have all of you
with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marianne knelt down beside her, in her caressing way:</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is so nice, isn&rsquo;t she, Aunt Adeline? I say, Aunt
Adeline, isn&rsquo;t she a darling? So nice, so jolly, so homy. I adore
Aunt Constance these days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she embraced Constance impetuously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Constance,&rdquo; said Adeline, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very
fond of you too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she took her sister-in-law&rsquo;s hand. She was a very gentle,
simple, fair-haired little woman, the quiet, obedient little wife of
her big, noisy Gerrit; and the family thought her insignificant and
boring. Because Constance had at once sought her affection <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb130" href="#pb130" name="pb130">130</a>]</span>and
valued her affection, she had, after her first surprise, grown very
fond of Constance. She never went out in the evening, because of the
children, except when Constance invited her. And she sat there, happy
to be with Constance, with her gentle smile on her round, fair,
motherly little face, pleasant and comfortable with her matronly little
figure, now too plump for prettiness.</p>
<p>The men joined them; and, when Constance saw Brauws come in with the
others, she thought that he looked strange, pale under the rough bronze
of his cheeks. His deep, grey eyes seemed to lose themselves in their
own sombre depths; and for the first time she examined his features in
detail: they were somewhat irregular in outline, with the short-cropped
hair; his nose was large and straight and the heavy eyebrows arched
sombrely over the sombre eyes; his temples were broad and level; his
cheekbones wide; and all that part of his face was energetic,
intelligent, rough and sombre, a little Gothic and barbarian, but yet
curiously ascetic, with the asceticism of the thinker. But the mouth
might have belonged to quite another face: almost weak, more finely and
purely drawn than any of his other features; the lips fresh, without
any heavy sensuality; the white teeth seemed to hold a laughing threat
as though they would bite: a threat that gave him the look of a beast
of prey. And yet that mouth, the moustache and the chin had something
more delicate about them, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb131" href=
"#pb131" name="pb131">131</a>]</span>as though they belonged to another
face; his voice was gentle; and his laugh, which every now and then
burst out naturally and clearly, was charming, had a note of
kindliness, which softened all that was rough and threatening into
something surprisingly lovable. In his vigorous, broad, powerful
movements he had retained an almost unceremonious freedom, which most
certainly remained to him from his workman years: an indifference to
the chair in which he sat, to the mantelpiece against which he leant;
an indifference which seemed a strong and virile, easy and natural
grace in the man of culture whose hands had laboured: something
original and almost impulsive, which, when it did not charm, was bound
to appear antipathetic, rude and rough to any one who was expecting the
manners prescribed by social convention for a gentleman in a
drawing-room. Constance was sometimes surprised that she, of all women,
was not offended by this unceremonious freedom, that she was even
attracted by it; but a nervous girl like Marianne&mdash;herself a
delicate, fragile little doll of boudoir culture&mdash;would tingle to
her finger-tips with irritation at that impulsive naturalness, which
was too spacious for her among the furniture of Aunt Constance&rsquo;
drawing-room. And a sort of uncontrollable resentment surged through
her when Brauws came to where she sat and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you always &hellip; take such an interest in evolution,
freule?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb132" href="#pb132" name=
"pb132">132</a>]</span></p>
<p>She looked up at him quickly. He was bending forward a little, in a
protecting and almost mocking attitude; and she saw only the barbaric,
Teutonic part of his head and the beast-of-prey threat of his handsome
teeth. She hated it all, because it was very strong and as it were
hostile to her caste. She answered, with cool irony:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Mr. Brauws, only in your case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And to what do I owe the honour?&rdquo; asked Brauws.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only natural. You were not like everybody &hellip;
once. Now that I am meeting you just as I meet everybody, it interests
me to know how it came about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From weakness, you think? Is that your secret
idea?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you are right. And, if it were so, would you despise
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The conversation was getting on her nerves. She tried to evade
it:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may be weak, you may be strong,&rdquo; she said,
irritably. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know &hellip; and &hellip; it
doesn&rsquo;t interest me so very much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It did just now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again she looked up quickly, with the quick, nervous grace of all
her movements, and it flashed upon her that he was very angry with her,
very hostile towards her. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb133" href=
"#pb133" name="pb133">133</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Aunt Constance!&rdquo; she called. &ldquo;Do come and help
me. Mr. Brauws isn&rsquo;t at all nice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Constance came up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not nice, your friend,&rdquo; Marianne went on,
like a spoilt child, a little frightened. &ldquo;He wants &hellip; he
absolutely insists on quarrelling with me. Do take my part!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she suddenly flitted away to another chair and, bending behind
her fan to Van der Welcke:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That Brauws man is a most disagreeable person. Why
can&rsquo;t he let me alone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She felt safe with him, this man of her own class, who joined hands
with her own selfish, happiness-craving youth&mdash;for he was
young&mdash;a small soul, like hers. Her small soul hung on his eyes;
and she felt that she loved him. As long as she did not think about it
and abandoned herself to her overflowing happiness, she remained happy,
full of radiance; it was only at home that it cost her tears and bitter
agony.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re surely not angry with my little niece?&rdquo;
asked Constance.</p>
<p>He was still pale, under the rough bronze of his cheeks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, sombrely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; she asked, almost beseechingly. &ldquo;She is a
child!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, she is not merely a child. She represents to
me&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb134" href=
"#pb134" name="pb134">134</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All of you!&rdquo; he said, roughly, with a wave of his
hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whom do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her caste, to which you yourself belong. What am I here for?
Tell me what I am here for. A single word from that delicate,
lily-white child, who hates me, has made me ask myself, what am I here
for, among all of you? I&rsquo;m out of place here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. You are our friend, Henri&rsquo;s friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Already?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Already. So don&rsquo;t think that you are out of place
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You also are a woman &hellip; of your caste,&rdquo; he said,
gloomily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can I help that?&rdquo; she asked, half laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. But why friendship? Our ideas remain poles
apart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ideas? I have none. I have never thought.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never thought?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a woman: you have only felt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not that either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not felt? But then what have you done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not believe that I have lived.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not ever?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not ever.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb135"
href="#pb135" name="pb135">135</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know that now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am beginning to feel it now, by degrees. No doubt because I
am getting old now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are not old.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am old.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And thinking: are you also beginning to think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, by the way you speak of yourself, you are quite
young!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be angry with that child!&rdquo; she entreated,
turning the conversation. &ldquo;She is a nice girl, I am very fond of
her &hellip; but she sometimes says things&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you like her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t. I could almost say, I hate her as she hates
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; she asked, in a frightened voice. &ldquo;You
don&rsquo;t know her. You can&rsquo;t hate her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am different from other people, am I not, mevrouw? I say
different things and I say them differently. You know it, you knew it
before I entered your house!&rdquo; he said, almost fiercely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to say something to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That child &hellip; that delicate, that lily-white child
&hellip; is&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb136" href=
"#pb136" name="pb136">136</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;The danger to your domestic happiness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She gave a violent start:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s in love with Hans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; she whispered, trembling, and laid her hand on
his hand. &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is in love with Hans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see it&#8202;&hellip;. It radiates from their whole
being&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They both of them looked at Van der Welcke and Marianne. The two
were whispering together with a glance and a smile, half-hidden behind
a fan, while Paul, Gerrit and Van Vreeswijck were in the midst of an
eager discussion and Addie gallantly entertaining Aunt Adeline, who was
smiling gently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please hush!&rdquo; Constance entreated again, very pale.
&ldquo;I <i>know</i> she&rsquo;s in love with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has she told you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. But I see it radiating out of her, as you see it. But she
is no danger &hellip; to my domestic happiness. That happiness lies in
my son, not in my husband.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like Hans,&rdquo; he said, almost reproachfully. &ldquo;I
have always liked him, perhaps just because he was always a
child&mdash;and I already a man&mdash;when we were boys. He is still a
child. He also &hellip; loves <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb137"
href="#pb137" name="pb137">137</a>]</span>her. You see, I say different
things from other people, because I don&rsquo;t know how to
talk&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;that he loves
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has he told you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. But I see it radiating out of him as I do out of
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush, please hush!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use of hushing? <i>Everybody</i> sees
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not everybody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we see it, everybody sees it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say yes. I know that your brothers see it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&#8202;&hellip;. Please, please &hellip; don&rsquo;t speak
of it, don&rsquo;t speak of it, don&rsquo;t speak of it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is happy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She must be suffering as well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But she gives herself up to her happiness. She is young, she
does not reflect &hellip; any more than Hans does. I am sorry &hellip;
for your sake, mevrouw.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is no sorrow to me for my own sake&#8202;&hellip;. I am
sorry &hellip; for hers. Don&rsquo;t be angry with the child! Who knows
what she suffers! Don&rsquo;t be angry because she &hellip; annoyed you
at dinner, with her questions.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb138" href="#pb138" name="pb138">138</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;One can&rsquo;t control one&rsquo;s likes &hellip; or
one&rsquo;s dislikes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. But I do like the girl &hellip; and I want you to try, as
our friend, not to hate her&#8202;&hellip;. How seriously we&rsquo;re
talking! I can&rsquo;t talk like that: I&rsquo;m not used to it. I
confess to you honestly, I&rsquo;m getting
frightened&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of me?&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re too big &hellip; to hate a child like
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not big at all&#8202;&hellip;. I am very human. I
sometimes feel very small. But you are right: to hate that child, for a
single word which she said, for a touch of hostility which I felt in
her, is <i>very</i> small. Thanks for the rebuke. I won&rsquo;t hate
her, I promise you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At first, the sombre austerity of his frown and his expression had
almost terrified her. She now saw his lips laugh and his face light
up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to apologize.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t do that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went to Marianne; and Constance heard him say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Freule, I want to make friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did not catch what Marianne answered, but she heard the little
bells of Marianne&rsquo;s laughter and saw her put out her hand to
Brauws. It was a reconciliation; and yet she felt that the hostility
continued to exist, irreconcilably, like a hostility that was
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb139" href="#pb139" name=
"pb139">139</a>]</span>too deep-seated, going down to the fundamental
antagonism of caste, even though this was innate in her and cultivated
in him&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;do not <i>I</i> feel that
hostility?&hellip;&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb140" href=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There was a big official dinner at Van Naghel&rsquo;s;
and the guests were expected in three-quarters of an hour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mamma,&rdquo; whined Huigje to Frances, as she was dressing,
&ldquo;what&rsquo;s happening?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are people coming,&rdquo; said Frances, without looking
up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What sort of people, Mamma?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, there&rsquo;s a dinner-party, dear!&rdquo; said Frances,
irritably.</p>
<p>Huigje did not know what a dinner-party was:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s dinner-party?&rdquo; he asked his little sister
Ottelientje.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Things to eat,&rdquo; said Ottelientje, importantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Things to eat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, nice things &hellip; ices.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall we have dinner-party, Mamma, and ices?&rdquo; whined
Huigje.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Allah</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3247src" href=
"#xd26e3247" name="xd26e3247src">1</a> <i>baboe</i>,<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e3253src" href="#xd26e3253" name="xd26e3253src">2</a> keep the
<i>sinjo</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e3261src" href="#xd26e3261"
name="xd26e3261src">3</a> with you!&hellip; But, <i>baboe</i>, do me up
first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Otto, who now had a billet at the Foreign Office, came in, followed
by Louise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, aren&rsquo;t you dressing, Louise?&rdquo; said
Frances.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not going down,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;I
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb141" href="#pb141" name=
"pb141">141</a>]</span>shall have my meal with the children and with
Marietje and Karel, in the nursery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want you to have your dinner with the
children,&rdquo; said Frances, fastening her bracelet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Louise, gently, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m having
dinner with Karel and Marie in any case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One would think you were mad,&rdquo; said Frances. &ldquo;Why
aren&rsquo;t you at the dinner?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I arranged it with Mamma. There&rsquo;s a place
short.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;re not a child!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Frances, what do I care about these dinners?&rdquo; said
Louise, with a gentle little laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If there&rsquo;s a place short,&rdquo; said Frances, working
herself up about nothing, &ldquo;<i>I&rsquo;ll</i> have my dinner with
the children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Frances, please&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Frances, why make difficulties when there are
none?&rdquo; Louise replied, very gently. &ldquo;Really, it has all
been arranged &hellip; with Mamma.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m only a step-daughter!&rdquo; cried Frances.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean, a daughter-in-law!&rdquo; Otto put in, with a
laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A step-daughter!&rdquo; Frances repeated, trembling with
nervous irritation. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a daughter. Your place is at
the dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Frances, I assure you, I&rsquo;m not going in to
dinner,&rdquo; said Louise, quietly but decidedly. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb142" href="#pb142" name="pb142">142</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, shut up, Frances!&rdquo; said Otto.</p>
<p>But Frances wanted to get angry, about nothing, merely for the sake
of working herself up. She scolded the <i>baboe</i>, pushed the
children out of her way, broke a fan:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, I&rsquo;ve smashed the rotten thing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that your new fan?&rdquo; asked Otto, furiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. R-r-rootsh!&hellip; There, it&rsquo;s in
shreds!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He flew into a rage:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll ever give you anything
again!&hellip; You&rsquo;re not worth it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, then you can give everything to your
sister: you&rsquo;re fonder of Louise as it is &hellip; you&rsquo;re in
love with Louise. R-r-rootsh!&hellip; R-r-rootsh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she sent the fan flying across the room, in pieces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh, <i>njonja</i>!&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3336src"
href="#xd26e3336" name="xd26e3336src">4</a> said the <i>baboe</i> in
mild astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a regular <i>nonna</i>,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e3347src" href="#xd26e3347" name="xd26e3347src">5</a> that&rsquo;s
what you are!&rdquo; said Otto, flushing angrily.</p>
<p>But his wife laughed. The broken fan had relieved her, made her feel
livelier:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me that other fan, <i>baboe</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was ready. She looked at her face in the glass, added a touch of
powder and smiled. She thought that she looked nice, though she was a
little <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb143" href="#pb143" name=
"pb143">143</a>]</span>pale and thin. Suddenly, she sat down, straight
up in a chair:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel so faint!&rdquo; she murmured.</p>
<p>Louise went to her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, Frances?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel so faint!&rdquo; she said, almost inaudibly.</p>
<p>She was as white as a sheet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me some eau-de-Cologne&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with you now?&rdquo; cried Otto, in
despair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Baboe</i>,&rdquo; said Louise, &ldquo;get some vinegar;
mevrouw&rsquo;s fainting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; moaned Frances, &ldquo;vinegar &hellip; stains
&hellip; one&rsquo;s &hellip; things&#8202;&hellip;. Mind &hellip; my
&hellip; dress. Eau &hellip; de &hellip; Cologne.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Louise dabbed her forehead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ruffle my hair!&rdquo; screamed Frances.</p>
<p><span class="corr" id="xd26e3389" title=
"Not in source">&ldquo;</span>Oh dear, oh dear!&rdquo; she moaned, the
next second.</p>
<p>She rested her head against Louise:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Louise!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, Frances?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t been nice to you&#8202;&hellip;. I&rsquo;m
going to die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, you&rsquo;re not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am&#8202;&hellip;. Huigje! Ottelientje! Mamma&rsquo;s
going to die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Otto took the children out of the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave them with me!&rdquo; she moaned. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
dying!&hellip;&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb144" href=
"#pb144" name="pb144">144</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Frances. But won&rsquo;t you lie down a little? Take off
your things? Lie down on your bed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No &hellip; no &hellip; I&rsquo;m a little
better&#8202;&hellip;. I must go down&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you feeling better?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&#8202;&hellip;. Give me some &hellip;
eau-de-Cologne&#8202;&hellip;. Oh, Louise, everything suddenly went
black!&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You felt giddy, I expect. Did you take your drops
to-day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but they&rsquo;re no good, those drops. I&rsquo;m much
better now, Louise. Are you angry with me?&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For saying Otto was in love with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, nonsense, Frances!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he is in love with you. You&rsquo;re mad, you two:
brother and sister; I never heard of such a thing&#8202;&hellip;.
I&rsquo;m better, Louise. Will you help me downstairs? And will you
&hellip; <i>will</i> you have your dinner with the children?
That&rsquo;s sweet of you&#8202;&hellip;. You see, the foreign
secretary&rsquo;s coming and that&rsquo;s why Papa wants Otto and me to
be at the dinner. Otherwise I don&rsquo;t care about that sort of
thing&#8202;&hellip;. I&rsquo;m much better now, Louise&#8202;&hellip;.
Come, take me downstairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stood up and Louise helped her down the stairs, tenderly.</p>
<p>The maids were running upstairs, downstairs and along the passages;
footmen were waiting in the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb145" href=
"#pb145" name="pb145">145</a>]</span>hall; the house was one blaze of
light. In the drawing-room, Bertha, already dressed, was speaking to
Willem, the butler; the doors were open, showing the long table
glittering through its flowers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with Frances?&rdquo; asked Bertha,
seeing Frances come in slowly, looking very pale, leaning on
Louise&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m better now, Mamma&#8202;&hellip;. I thought I was
dying&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that moment, there was a loud peal at the front-door bell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who can that be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of the footmen opened the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo; asked Bertha, softly, from the stairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s I, Mamma!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Emilie!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes &hellip; I&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Emilie came up. She had flung down a wet waterproof in the hall and
was very pale; her hair hung in disorder over her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Emilie &hellip; what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had flown upstairs precipitately, seeing nothing; now she
suddenly perceived the rooms, all open and lit up, with the long table
and the flowers; and she remembered that there was a
dinner-party&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve run away!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not
going back!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Run away!&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb146" href=
"#pb146" name="pb146">146</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Eduard struck me &hellip; and insulted me &hellip;
insulted me&#8202;&hellip;. I won&rsquo;t go back home&#8202;&hellip;.
I shall stay here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Emilie! Good heavens!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unless you turn me away&#8202;&hellip;. Then I&rsquo;ll go
into the streets, I don&rsquo;t know where &hellip; to Leiden &hellip;
to Henri&#8202;&hellip;. I&rsquo;ll go to Henri. Understand what I say,
Mamma: I&rsquo;ll <i>never</i> go back to Eduard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Van Naghel appeared at the door:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s happened, Emilie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Papa, Papa, I&rsquo;ve run away&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Run away&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From Eduard. It&rsquo;s a dog&rsquo;s life. He&rsquo;s a
miser. He&rsquo;s always bullying me, reproaching me, saying that I
spend too much money &hellip; that my parents, yes, that you &hellip;
that <i>you</i> spend too much money! He&rsquo;s mad with meanness. He
locks up my linen-cupboard &hellip; because I wear too many chemises
and send too many things to the wash and employ too expensive a
laundress! He grudges me more than one chemise a week! He&rsquo;s mad
&hellip; he&rsquo;s gone mad! For a whole week, I put on three fresh
chemises a day, to annoy him, and I threw all those chemises into
<i>his</i> dirty-clothes-basket, to annoy him! He found them this
morning! I told him that I was the mistress of my own chemises and that
I should wear just as many as I pleased. Then he flew into a passion
and he struck me&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She burst out laughing: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb147" href=
"#pb147" name="pb147">147</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I flung all my chemises at his head!&rdquo; she screamed,
hysterically. &ldquo;And he flung them all back. The room was one vast
chemise!&hellip; Oh, it&rsquo;s terrible&#8202;&hellip;. It&rsquo;s a
dog&rsquo;s life. I won&rsquo;t go back to him&#8202;&hellip;. Papa, I
needn&rsquo;t go back to him, need I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Emilie, you ought to be ashamed of yourself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She threw herself upon her father, crushed herself against the
orders on his breast:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Papa, I am so unhappy! I can&rsquo;t stand any more of
it: I am so unhappy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marianne came in. She was looking very pretty: a delicate, fair
little society-girl, in her low-necked white frock. She heard
Emilie&rsquo;s last words, saw her pale, thin, dishevelled:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Emilietje!&hellip; Sissy!&hellip; What is it?&rdquo; she
exclaimed. &ldquo;Oh, that horrid man! It&rsquo;s that horrid
man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bertha shut her eyes:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Emilie,&rdquo; she said, wearily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mamma, don&rsquo;t be angry &hellip; but <i>I&rsquo;m
staying</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bell rang.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the bell, Emilie!&rdquo; said Van Naghel,
sternly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going, Papa&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked around her in perplexity, not knowing which door to go
out by.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come with me,&rdquo; said Louise, quickly. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb148" href="#pb148" name="pb148">148</a>]</span></p>
<p>And, taking Emilie almost in her arms, she hurried her away.</p>
<p>The first arrivals were coming up the stairs. Louise and Emilie just
managed to escape into a little boudoir. But the doors were open.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can run across the passage presently,&rdquo; whispered
Louise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just think,&rdquo; whispered Emilie, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s
absolutely mad! He interferes with the cook&rsquo;s housekeeping-book.
He checks what she spends each day&#8202;&hellip;. He&rsquo;s mad,
he&rsquo;s mad! He won&rsquo;t eat at meals, so as to save a bit of
meat for next day. And, when we give a little dinner, nothing&rsquo;s
good enough. It&rsquo;s all for people, all for show: he&rsquo;d
starve, in order to give his friends champagne!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush, Emilie!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They heard the exchange of greetings in the drawing-room; their
parents&rsquo; well-bred, expressionless voices; Marianne&rsquo;s
nervous, tinkling laugh; Otto and Frances making up to the foreign
secretary. It all sounded false. The bell kept on ringing. More guests
came upstairs, with a rustle of skirts, a creaking of
shoes&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t get away!&rdquo; said Emilie, plaintively,
almost collapsing in Louise&rsquo;s arms.</p>
<p>They succeeded in running upstairs between two rings at the bell.
The table was laid in the nursery: Karel and Marietje were there,
playing with Ottelientje and Huig; the <i>baboe</i> sat huddled in a
corner. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb149" href="#pb149" name=
"pb149">149</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have something with you!&rdquo; said Emilie.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m faint with hunger&#8202;&hellip;. What a day, good
God, what a day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get something to eat in between,&rdquo; said
Louise. &ldquo;Come, Emilie, come to my room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And, as if they were fleeing again, this time from the children, she
dragged Emilie up to her own room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Emilie, do be sensible!&rdquo; she implored.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Louise, I mean what I said, give me a glass of wine, a
biscuit, anything: I&rsquo;m sinking&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Louise went out and Emilie was left alone. She looked around the
bright, cosy sitting-room, stamped with the gentle personality of its
owner: there were many books about; the doors of a book-case were
open.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The dear girl!&rdquo; thought Emilie, lying back wearily in a
chair. &ldquo;She lives her own life peacefully &hellip; and, when
there&rsquo;s anything wrong, she&rsquo;s the one who helps. Her life
just goes on, the same thing day after day! She was a girl while we
were still children; and, properly speaking, we never knew her as we
know one another. She&rsquo;s fond of Otto, just as I&rsquo;m very fond
of Otto &hellip; but, apart from that, her life just goes on in the
same way&#8202;&hellip;. She&rsquo;s always silent&#8202;&hellip;. She
just lives and reads up here &hellip; and, if there&rsquo;s anything
wrong, she&rsquo;s the one who helps&#8202;&hellip;. What have I done,
my God, what have I done!&hellip; But I won&rsquo;t go
back!&hellip;&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb150" href="#pb150"
name="pb150">150</a>]</span></p>
<p>Louise returned, with a glass of wine and a few biscuits.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re dining presently,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;There,
drink that and be sensible, Emilie. Does Eduard know you&rsquo;re
here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. He was out when I left. I waited till he was
out&#8202;&hellip;. Louise, I won&rsquo;t go back! I&rsquo;ve
telegraphed to Henri to help me. I&rsquo;m expecting him
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They heard voices below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; said Louise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it&rsquo;s some one who has come late&#8202;&hellip;.
But that&rsquo;s impossible&#8202;&hellip;. I hear a noise on the
stairs&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My God!&rdquo; cried Emilie. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Eduard! Hide
me! Say you don&rsquo;t know where I am!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do that, Emilie. Keep calm, Emilie, be
sensible. Go to my bedroom, if you like&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Emilie fled. It was a renewed flight, the fluttering of a young
bird, a frail butterfly, hither and thither. Her eyes seemed to be
seeking, vaguely and anxiously&#8202;&hellip;. She and Louise had to go
down to the next landing and Emilie managed to escape to
Marianne&rsquo;s room, once the boudoir which they had shared between
them:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My own little room!&rdquo; she sobbed, throwing herself into
a chair. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb151" href="#pb151" name=
"pb151">151</a>]</span></p>
<p>The gas was half-lowered. Everywhere lay things of Marianne&rsquo;s;
the dressing-table was in disorder, as though Marianne had had to dress
quickly and hurriedly for the dinner-party.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How nice she looked!&rdquo; sobbed Emilie. &ldquo;My little
sister, my dear little sister! O God, they say she&rsquo;s in love with
Uncle Henri!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She sprang up again in nervous restlessness, turned the gas on,
looked round, anxiously, feeling lost, even in this room:</p>
<p>&ldquo;His portrait!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Uncle Henri&rsquo;s
portrait!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She saw Van der Welcke&rsquo;s photograph. True, it was between
Constance&rsquo; and Addie&rsquo;s; but there was another on
Marianne&rsquo;s writing-table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My little sister, my poor little sister!&rdquo; sobbed
Emilie.</p>
<p>And she dropped limply into another chair, on the top of a corset
and petticoats of Marianne&rsquo;s. She lay like that, with drooping
arms, among her sister&rsquo;s things. Suddenly she sat up. She heard
voices outside, in the passage: Louise with Eduard, her husband.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s mad, she&rsquo;s mad!&rdquo; he was snarling.
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s run away! The servant didn&rsquo;t know where to.
Where is she, where is she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s here,&rdquo; said Louise, calmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb152" href=
"#pb152" name="pb152">152</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s resting. But keep calm, Eduard, and don&rsquo;t
let them hear you downstairs. There&rsquo;s a dinner-party.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care! I <i>insist</i>&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <i>insist</i> that you keep quiet and don&rsquo;t make a
scene&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is Emilie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re quiet, you can speak to her. If you shout
like that, so that you can be heard downstairs, I&rsquo;ll send a
message to Papa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Emilie, on tenterhooks, quivering in every nerve, stood up and
opened the door:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am here,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>She stood in front of her husband. He was no longer the dapper
nonentity; he stood there coarse, raving, like a clod-hopper:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re coming home with me!&rdquo; he shouted.
&ldquo;This minute!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eduard!&rdquo; Louise entreated. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t shout.
Come in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She pushed him into Marianne&rsquo;s room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re coming home!&rdquo; he shouted again. &ldquo;Are
you coming? Are you coming?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not,&rdquo; said Emilie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! I won&rsquo;t go back to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want a divorce.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t; and you&rsquo;re coming home.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb153" href="#pb153" name=
"pb153">153</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going home. You&rsquo;ve struck me &hellip; and
I&rsquo;m placing myself under my father&rsquo;s protection. I
don&rsquo;t know the law, but I&rsquo;m not going to be struck by
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t come &hellip; I&rsquo;ll make you,
I&rsquo;ll thrash you to the door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She gave a contemptuous laugh:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not a man,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
a cowardly brute!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He raved as though beside himself. He cursed and foamed at the
mouth. Louise stared at him in dismay; hardly knew him, now that he had
lost all his veneer of manner, all his German, would-be correct
politeness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Home you go!&rdquo; he roared again, pointing to the door
with his finger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He flew at her, seized her by her frail shoulders, shook her, his
mouth distorted by passion, his eyes starting out of his head, like a
madman&rsquo;s. She writhed herself free, struck him full in the face.
He hit her back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eduard! Emilie!&rdquo; screamed Louise.</p>
<p>Her anger gave her strength. She threw herself upon her
brother-in-law, strong in her indignation, pushed him away from his
wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go away!&rdquo; she cried aloud, clasping Emilie in her arms.
&ldquo;Go away! Out of the room!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want my wife back!&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb154" href="#pb154" name="pb154">154</a>]</span></p>
<p>Louise calmed herself:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eduard,&rdquo; she said, quietly, &ldquo;leave the
room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once more, Eduard, leave the room, or I&rsquo;ll send one of
the men to Papa. If you want to make a scandal, very well, do; but
you&rsquo;ll be the chief sufferer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He suddenly remembered the Hague, his career&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go out of the room, Eduard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s hurt me!&rdquo; moaned Emilie. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
got a pain, here&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She lay like a dead thing in her sister&rsquo;s arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eduard, go out of the room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But I shall stay until
the dinner is over&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The wretch! The wretch!&rdquo; moaned Emilie.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s bruised my breast. Lucky that he did: now I can get a
divorce, can&rsquo;t I, Louise?&hellip; Louise, do you know the
law?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, my darling, but Papa will tell you all about it. But keep
calm, keep calm&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where has he gone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t mind being left alone, I&rsquo;ll go and
see&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, stay with me, stay with me&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a knock at the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb155" href="#pb155" name="pb155">155</a>]</span></p>
<p>An old nurse entered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Freule,&rdquo; she said to Louise, &ldquo;meneer asks if
you&rsquo;ll please not talk so loud up here. Meneer can hear Mr. van
Raven&rsquo;s voice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is Mr. van Raven now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The blackguard has gone to Mr. Frans and Mr. Henri&rsquo;s
sitting-room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, Leentje, we&rsquo;ll make less noise. But you
mustn&rsquo;t talk like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It hurts!&rdquo; moaned Emilie.</p>
<p>The woman looked at her compassionately:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The dirty blackguard!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Did he hit you,
my poor dear?&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leentje, I won&rsquo;t have you speak like that!&rdquo; said
Louise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll tell him to his face &hellip; that he&rsquo;s
a dirty blackguard,&rdquo; the old nurse insisted, obstinately.</p>
<p>She knelt beside Emilie, opened the girl&rsquo;s blouse and softly
rubbed her breast:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The blackguard!&rdquo; she repeated.</p>
<p>The sisters let her alone. They were silent, all three; the room was
all in confusion. Emilie had dropped back again limply among
Marianne&rsquo;s clothes. Leentje got up and began tidying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Louise,&rdquo; whispered Emilie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My poor sissy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see Uncle Henri&rsquo;s portrait there&#8202;&hellip;. And
there&#8202;&hellip;. And another over there&#8202;&hellip;.
Marianne&rsquo;s fond of Uncle Henri&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb156" href="#pb156" name=
"pb156">156</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but hush!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s fond of him &hellip; she&rsquo;s in love with
him, Louise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know. Hush, Emilie!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does Mamma know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t talk about it. But I think so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does everybody know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, not everybody!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does Marianne never talk about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, never.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there nothing to be done? Aunt Adolphine and Aunt Cateau
were speaking of it the other day. Everybody knows about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, not everybody, surely?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, everybody. And everybody knows too that Eduard beats
me&#8202;&hellip;. Louise!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ssh! I hear voices.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s &hellip; Henri!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s Henri&rsquo;s
voice&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Eduard&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heavens!&hellip; Leentje!&rdquo; cried Louise. &ldquo;Go to
Mr. Henri and Mr. Eduard and tell them that Papa doesn&rsquo;t wish
them to speak loud.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The blackguard!&rdquo; said Leentje.</p>
<p>She left the room and went down the stairs. The whole house was lit
up, the doors of the reception-rooms were open; one caught the glitter
of the dinner-table amid its flowers and the sound of laughing
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb157" href="#pb157" name=
"pb157">157</a>]</span>voices: a soft, well-bred society-ripple, a ring
of silver, a faint tinkling of crystal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The blackguard!&rdquo; thought the old nurse.</p>
<p>She was down in the hall now: from the kitchen came the voices of
bustling maids, of the <i>chef</i>, the footmen. The cloak-room was
lighted and open, was full of wraps and overcoats. On the other side of
the hall was the sitting-room of the two undergraduates.</p>
<p>Old Leentje opened the door. She saw Van Raven standing opposite
Henri; their voices clashed, in bitter enmity:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why did Emilie telegraph to me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know; but our affairs don&rsquo;t concern
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Henri, Mr. Eduard,&rdquo; said the old nurse, &ldquo;your
papa asks, will you please not speak loud&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is Emilie?&rdquo; asked Henri.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The poor dear is in Marianne&rsquo;s room,&rdquo; said
Leentje. &ldquo;Come with me, my boy&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She took Henri, who was shaking all over, by the hand. And, as she
left the room with Henri, she said, out loud:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The blackguard!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; asked Henri.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What has he done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What hasn&rsquo;t he done!&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb158" href="#pb158" name="pb158">158</a>]</span></p>
<p>She hesitated to tell him, dreading his temper, went cautiously up
the stairs, past the open doors of the lighted rooms.</p>
<p>Henri caught a glimpse of the dinner-table, through the flowers, and
of three of the guests talking and laughing, lightly and pleasantly, in
their well-bred, expressionless voices.</p>
<p>And then he found his two sisters in Marianne&rsquo;s room. As soon
as Emilie saw him, she threw herself into his arms:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Henri!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sissy, what is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She told him, briefly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cad!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;The cad! Has he hit you?
I&rsquo;ll &hellip; I&rsquo;ll &hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He wanted to rush downstairs; they held him back:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Henri, for goodness&rsquo; sake,&rdquo; Louise entreated,
&ldquo;remember there are people here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you all want your dinner?&rdquo; asked Karel, at
the door. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re starving.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They went to the nursery, as it had been called for years, and sat
down to table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not hungry now,&rdquo; said Emilie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want anything either,&rdquo; said Henri.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m calmer now &hellip; and I&rsquo;m going
downstairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They held him back again. And the time dragged on. Ottelientje and
Huig were put to bed; Karel went to do his home-work; Marietje hung
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb159" href="#pb159" name=
"pb159">159</a>]</span>round her elder sisters, inquisitively. And they
listened, with the doors open, to the sounds below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve finished dinner&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I can hear them in the
drawing-room&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marianne suddenly came running upstairs, appeared in the doorway,
looking very white and sweet:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t bear it any longer!&rdquo; she exclaimed.
&ldquo;The dinner&rsquo;s over. I escaped for a moment. Emilie!
Sissy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s here!&rdquo; said Emilie. &ldquo;Eduard:
he&rsquo;s waiting downstairs. He wants to take me home with him. You
must all help me. He struck me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My sissy, my sissy!&rdquo; cried Marianne, excitedly,
wringing her arms and her hands, kissing Emilie. &ldquo;Is he
downstairs? I&rsquo;ll tell Papa. I daren&rsquo;t stay any longer. Oh,
those tiresome people down there! It&rsquo;s nearly nine. They&rsquo;ll
be gone in an hour. Now I must go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she started to hurry away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marianne!&rdquo; said Henri.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to speak to you presently.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, presently.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she flitted down the stairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How pretty she&rsquo;s growing!&rdquo; said Henri.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I,&rdquo; said Emilie, &ldquo;so ugly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She leant against Louise. They heard a rustle on the stairs. It was
Bertha herself: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb160" href="#pb160"
name="pb160">160</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;My child!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mamma!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I managed to slip away, just for a moment. My dear
child!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eduard is here, Mamma. He&rsquo;s downstairs. He wants to
take me away with him. He is waiting till the people are gone. He was
shouting so&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We told him to be quiet. I won&rsquo;t go with him, Mamma.
I&rsquo;ll stay with you, I&rsquo;ll stay with you. He struck
me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cad!&rdquo; cried Henri, pale in the face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The dirty blackguard!&rdquo; said the old nurse.</p>
<p>Bertha, very pale, shut her eyes, heaved a deep sigh:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My child, my dear child &hellip; be sensible, make it
up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he is brutal to me, Mamma!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She flung herself, sobbing, into Bertha&rsquo;s arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My darling!&rdquo; Bertha wept. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t stay
away any longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She released herself, went away; her dress rustled down the stairs.
Her guests were sitting in the drawing-room; one or two looked at her
strangely, because she had absented herself. In a moment she was once
more the tactful, charming hostess.</p>
<p>Marianne, with a smile on her face, had gone to Van Naghel&rsquo;s
study, where the men were having their coffee, smoking: <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb161" href="#pb161" name="pb161">161</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Papa&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, dear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eduard is downstairs!&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;I only
came to tell you. He wants to take Emilie with him. He has struck
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell him I&rsquo;ll speak to him &hellip; as soon as our
visitors have gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And, as the host, he turned to his guests again.</p>
<p>Marianne went downstairs, found Eduard in the boys&rsquo;
sitting-room. He was quietly smoking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Papa will speak to you as soon as they&rsquo;re all gone. The
carriages will be here in three-quarters of an hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; he said laconically.</p>
<p>Her blood seethed up:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a cowardly wretch!&rdquo; she cried.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve struck Emilie!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He flared up, losing all his stiff German society-manners:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m her husband!&rdquo; he roared. &ldquo;But you
&hellip; you &hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve no decency! You&rsquo;re in love with your
uncle! With a married man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O-o-oh!&rdquo; screamed Marianne.</p>
<p>She hid her face with her hands, terrified. Then she recovered
herself, but her pale face flushed red with shame:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re saying!&rdquo; she
said, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb162" href="#pb162" name=
"pb162">162</a>]</span>haughtily, trying to withdraw into her maidenly
reserve. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re saying. But your
manners are only put on, for strangers. And at heart you&rsquo;re a
cowardly cad, a cowardly cad, who strikes and insults women.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He made an angry movement at her words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going to strike me, I suppose?&rdquo; she
said, drawing herself up haughtily. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve insulted me:
isn&rsquo;t that enough for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She made an effort to turn away calmly, walked out of the room, up
the stairs. The sobs welled up in her throat; she could no longer keep
them back:</p>
<p>&ldquo;O God!&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;Everybody knows it.
Everybody sees it. I can&rsquo;t keep it hidden: I love him, I love
him!&hellip; Hush! Hush! I must suppress it, deep, deep down in myself.
But, if I love him, if I love him &hellip; if I am happy when I see
him&#8202;&hellip;. Oh, hush, hush!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She pressed her two hands to her breast, as though to thrust her
emotion deep down in her soul. She wiped her eyes, had the strength to
return to the drawing-room. She talked gaily and pleasantly, as the
daughter of the house, but she suddenly felt tired to death:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everybody knows it, everybody sees it,&rdquo; she kept on
thinking; and she tried to read in the faces of the guests what they
saw, what they knew.</p>
<p>It was over at last. The butler was continually coming to the door,
announcing the carriages. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb163" href=
"#pb163" name="pb163">163</a>]</span>Those people would not remain much
longer. It was ten o&rsquo;clock; and they began to say good-bye. They
followed one after the other, at short intervals, as is proper at big
dinner-parties&#8202;&hellip;. There was only one of the ministers
left, talking earnestly to Van Naghel, in a low voice, probably about
some government matter: he was not thinking yet of
going&#8202;&hellip;. But at last he also hastened away, apologizing.
And Van Naghel and Bertha, Marianne, Frances and Otto all listened
while he put on his overcoat downstairs, said a word to the
butler&#8202;&hellip;. The front-door slammed. They were alone.</p>
<p>They looked at one another&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>And, as if driven by an irresistible impulse, Van Naghel went
downstairs, to his son-in-law, and Bertha and Marianne upstairs, to
Emilie&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mamma, have you come to me at last?&rdquo; said Emilie,
plaintively. &ldquo;Mamma, I shall stay here: I won&rsquo;t go
back&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was clutching Henri desperately; and Marianne went up to her,
comforted her, kissed her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marianne,&rdquo; said Henri, &ldquo;here, a
minute&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He led her out into the passage:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marianne,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t know how
fond I am of you &hellip; almost as fond as of Emilie. Marianne, let me
just say this to you: be sensible; everybody&rsquo;s talking about
it&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everybody?&rdquo; she asked, frightened; and she did not even
ask what it was, because she understood. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb164" href="#pb164" name="pb164">164</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;You even know it yourself then?&rdquo; he asked, quickly, to
take her by surprise.</p>
<p>She withdrew into the mysterious recesses of her little soul, which
was too transparent, reflected its radiance too much; she wanted to
veil that radiance from him and from the others:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing to
know!&hellip; Everybody? Everybody who? Everybody
what?&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everybody&rsquo;s talking about it, about Uncle Henri&rsquo;s
making love to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She tried to laugh; and the little silver bells sounded shrill and
false:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Making love to me?&hellip; Uncle Henri?&hellip; People are
mad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were out with him yesterday &hellip; in a
motor-car.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what is there in that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do it again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everybody&rsquo;s talking about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again she tried to laugh; and the little silver bells sounded shrill
and false:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle Henri!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Why, he might be my
father!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know you don&rsquo;t mean what you say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle Henri!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is a young man&#8202;&hellip;. Marianne, tell me that
it&rsquo;s not true&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb165" href="#pb165" name="pb165">165</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;That he makes love to me? I&rsquo;m fond of him &hellip; just
as I&rsquo;m fond of Aunt Constance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That you love him. There, you can&rsquo;t deny it. You love
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not love him,&rdquo; she lied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you do, you love him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not love him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, then, I do!&rdquo; she said, curtly. &ldquo;I love
him. What then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marianne&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like being with him, like talking to him, cycling with him,
motoring with him: what then? There&rsquo;s no harm in it; and &hellip;
I love Aunt Constance too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marianne, I&rsquo;ve warned you,&rdquo; he said, sadly.
&ldquo;Be sensible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;But you be sensible
also.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be sensible with Eduard! Control your temper, Henri! It can
only make things worse, if you don&rsquo;t control your
temper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will control myself!&rdquo; he promised, clenching his
fists as he spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Henri&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hate the bounder &hellip; I could murder him, wring his
neck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Henri, be quiet, I hear Papa coming.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb166" href="#pb166" name="pb166">166</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Promise me, Marianne, that you will be careful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Henri. And you promise me also, Henri, that you will be
careful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I promise you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She went up to him, put her arms round his neck:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My brother, my poor brother!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear little sister, my little sister!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush, hush!&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush!&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s Papa&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Van Naghel came up the stairs.</p>
<p>And they went with him into the nursery, where Bertha was waiting
with Emilie, Otto and Frances.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eduard has gone now,&rdquo; said Van Naghel, quietly.
&ldquo;I calmed him down; he is coming back to-morrow, to talk things
over. You can stay here to-night, Emilie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Papa, I won&rsquo;t go back to him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Emilie,&rdquo; cried Frances, excitedly, &ldquo;you
can&rsquo;t go back to him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be quiet, Frances,&rdquo; said Van Naghel, severely. And he
repeated, &ldquo;You &hellip; can &hellip; stay here, Emilie &hellip;
to-night&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He suddenly turned purple.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me what the law is, Papa,&rdquo; Emilie insisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The law?&rdquo; asked Van Naghel. &ldquo;The
law?&hellip;&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb167" href="#pb167"
name="pb167">167</a>]</span></p>
<p>And, almost black in the face, he pulled at his collar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bertha!&rdquo; he cried, in a hoarse voice.</p>
<p>They were all terrified&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>He tore open his collar, his tie, his shirt:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Air!&rdquo; he implored.</p>
<p>And his eyes started from his head, he staggered, fell into a
chair.</p>
<p>Louise rang the bell. The girls screamed for the maids, the butler.
Henri flew down the stairs to fetch a doctor.</p>
<p>It was was too late&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>Van Naghel lay dead, struck down by apoplexy. <span class=

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The winter months dragged sadly and monotonously past,
with their continual rains and no frost: even such snow as fell melted
at once in the raw, damp atmosphere. But the wind blew all the time,
kept on blowing from some mysterious cloud-realm, carrying the clouds
with it, violet clouds and grey clouds, a never-ending succession,
which came sailing over the trees in the Woods as though over the sea.
And Constance followed them with her eyes, vaguely and dreamily,
dreaming on and on in an endless reverie. The clouds sailed
everlastingly on the wind; and the wind blew everlastingly, like an
everlasting storm, not always raging, but always rustling, sometimes
high up above the trees, sometimes straight through the trees
themselves. Constance remained mostly at home and sat by her window
during those short afternoons, which she lengthened out in the dim
shadows of the fire-lit room, where at three o&rsquo;clock dusk was
falling&#8202;&hellip;. The everyday life went on, regularly and
monotonously: when the weather was tolerable, Van der Welcke went
bicycling; but for the rest he stayed upstairs a great deal, seldom
going to the Witte or the Plaats, smoking, cursing inwardly because he
was not rich enough to buy a &ldquo;sewing-machine&rdquo; of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb169" href="#pb169" name=
"pb169">169</a>]</span>his own. Addie went to and fro between home and
school; and it was he that enlivened the meals&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>And Constance, in her drawing-room, sat at the window and gazed at
the clouds, looked out at the rain. Through the silent monotony of her
short, grey days a dream began to weave itself, as with a luminous
thread, so that she was not oppressed by the sombre melancholy of the
rainy winter. When Van der Welcke went upstairs, cursing because it was
raining again and because he had nothing to do, she settled herself in
her drawing-room&mdash;in that room in which she lived and which was
tinged as it were with her own personality&mdash;and looked out at the
clouds, at the rain. She sat dreaming. She smiled, wide-eyed. She liked
the ever louring skies, the ever drifting clouds; and, though at times
the gusty squalls still made her start with that sudden catch in her
throat and breast, she loved the raging and rustling winds, listened to
them, content for them to blow and blow, high above her head, her
house, her trees&mdash;hers&mdash;till, blowing, they lost themselves
in the infinities beyond&#8202;&hellip;. She had her work beside her, a
book; but she did not sew, did not read: she dreamt&#8202;&hellip;. She
smiled, looking out, looking up at the endlessly rolling
skies&#8202;&hellip;. The clouds sailed by, sometimes high, sometimes
low, above the houses, above the people&rsquo;s heads, like passions
disdaining mankind: dank, monstrous passions riding arrogantly by upon
the passion of the winds, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb170" href=
"#pb170" name="pb170">170</a>]</span>from a far-off land of sheer
passion, sullen and tempestuous; and the threatening cohorts rolled on,
great and majestic, like Olympian deities towering above the petty
human strife hidden under the roofs over which they passed, ever
opening their mighty flood-gates&#8202;&hellip;. When Constance looked
up at them, the vast, phantom monsters, coming she knew not whence and
going she knew not whither, just shadowing across her life and followed
by new monsters, no less vast and no less big with mystery, she was not
afraid or sad, for she felt safe in her dream. The sombre skies had
always attracted her, even in the old days, though they used to
frighten her then, she did not know why; but now, now for the first
time she smiled, because she felt safe. A soft radiance shone from her
eyes, which gazed up at the phantom monsters. When the wind whistled,
soughed, moaned and bellowed round the house, like a giant soul in
pain, she remained as it were looking up at the wind, let her soul
swell softly in unison with its dirges, like something that surrenders
itself, small and weak but peaceful, to a mighty force. In her little
house, as she gazed out at the dreary road, on these winter days,
especially when it grew dark of an afternoon, the wind and the rain
round about her seemed almost one element, vast and sad as life, which
came from over the sea, which drifted away over the town and which
continued to hold her and her house in its embrace&#8202;&hellip;.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb171" href="#pb171" name=
"pb171">171</a>]</span></p>
<p>She looked outside, she smiled. Sometimes she heard her
husband&rsquo;s step in the passages, as he went through the house,
grumbling, muttering, cursing, because he wanted to go
out&#8202;&hellip;. Then she would think for a moment:</p>
<p>&ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t seen Marianne for days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But then she would think no more about either of them; and her dream
shone out before her again. The dream shone softly and unfalteringly,
like a gentle, steady ray: a path of soft light that issued as it were
from her eyes to the sombre, frowning clouds out yonder. Over the
soft-shining path something seemed to be wafted from her outwards,
upwards, far and wide and then back again, to where she
sat&#8202;&hellip;. It was so strange that she smiled at it, closed her
eyes; and, when she opened them, it was once more as though she saw her
dream, that path of light, always&#8202;&hellip;. Her dream took no
more definite shape and remained thus, a gentle, kindly glow, a pale,
soft ray from her to the sombre skies&#8202;&hellip;. It was dusk now
and she sat on, quite lost in the misty, shadowy darkness all around
her, quite invisible in the black room; and her eyes continued to stare
outside, at the last wan streaks in the darkening
heavens&#8202;&hellip;. The road outside was black&#8202;&hellip;. A
street-lamp shone out, throwing its harsh light upon a
puddle&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>Then she covered her face with her hands, ashamed because she had
sat musing so long, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb172" href="#pb172"
name="pb172">172</a>]</span>ashamed especially because she had allowed
herself to wander along that luminous thread, the path of her
dream&#8202;&hellip;. She rang, had the lamps lit and waited for Addie,
who would soon be home.</p>
<p>But those were the lonely afternoons&#8202;&hellip;. Sometimes in
those wet, dull afternoons when it grew dark so early, she saw
<i>his</i> figure pass the window, heard him ring. It was Brauws. She
did not move and she heard him go upstairs first, when Van der Welcke
was in. But, since he had recommenced his visits to their house, he had
got into the way of saying to Van der Welcke, in half an hour or
so:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I&rsquo;ll go and pay my respects to your
wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The first few times, Van der Welcke had gone with him to the
drawing-room; but, now that Brauws had taken to calling in a more
informal fashion, Van der Welcke stayed upstairs, let him go his own
way. And, after the first shock which Brauws&rsquo; ideas had produced
in their house, his friendship became something cheering and comforting
which both Van der Welcke and Constance continued to appreciate for
their own and each other&rsquo;s sakes. He and Van Vreeswijck were now
the only friends whom they both really liked, the two regular visitors
to their otherwise lonely house. And for that reason Van der Welcke let
Brauws go to Constance alone, staying away, never entering his
wife&rsquo;s drawing-room unnecessarily &hellip; except when he heard
the little bells of Marianne&rsquo;s voice and laugh. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb173" href="#pb173" name="pb173">173</a>]</span></p>
<p>Constance&rsquo; heart beat when she heard Brauws&rsquo; voice on
the stairs:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I&rsquo;ll go and pay my respects to your wife.
She&rsquo;s at home, isn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure to be, in this beastly weather.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She heard Brauws&rsquo; step, which made the stairs creak as it came
down them. Then she felt a violent emotion, of which she was secretly
ashamed, ashamed for herself. For she was severe with herself: she was
afraid of becoming ridiculous in her own eyes. When she felt her
emotion grow too violent, she at once conjured up Addie&rsquo;s image:
he was fourteen now. The mother of a son of fourteen! Then a smile of
ironic indulgence would curve the dimples by her lips; and it was with
the greatest composure that she welcomed Brauws:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it dark early? But it&rsquo;s only half-past
three and really too soon to light the lamp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are times when twilight upsets me,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;and times when it makes me feel very calm and
peaceful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sat down near her, contentedly, and his broad figure loomed
darkly in the little room, among the other shadows. The street-lamps
were already lighted outside, glittering harshly on the wet road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been awful weather lately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, so I prefer to stay indoors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re too much indoors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I go out whenever it&rsquo;s fine.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb174" href="#pb174" name="pb174">174</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t care for going out &lsquo;in all
weathers.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like looking at the weather from here. It&rsquo;s a
different sky every day&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then they talked on all sorts of subjects. He often spoke of Addie,
with a sort of enthusiasm which he had conceived for the lad. Her face
would glow with pride as she listened. And, almost involuntarily, she
told him how the boy had always been a comfort to them, to Van der
Welcke as well as to her. And, when she mentioned her husband&rsquo;s
name, he often answered, as though with a touch of reproach:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very fond of Hans. He is a child; and still
I&rsquo;m fond of him&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she would feel ashamed, because she had just had a wordy
dispute with Van der Welcke&mdash;about nothing at all&mdash;and she
would veer round and say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be helped. We can <i>not</i> get on. We endure
each other as well as we can. To separate would be too silly &hellip;
and also very sad for Addie. He is fond of both of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And their conversation again turned on the boy. Then she had to tell
him about Brussels and even about Rome.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s strange,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;When you were in
Brussels &hellip; I was living at Schaerbeek.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we never met.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, never. And, when you and Hans went to the Riviera, I was
there in the same year.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb175"
href="#pb175" name="pb175">175</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you come often to Monte Carlo?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once or twice, at any rate. Attracted by just that vivid
contrast between the atmosphere out there, where money has no value,
and my own ideas. It was a sort of self-inflicted torture. And we never
saw each other there&#8202;&hellip;. And, when you were here, in the
Hague, as a girl, I used often to come to the Hague and I even remember
often passing your parents&rsquo; house, where your mother still lives,
in the Alexanderstraat, and reading your name on the door: Van
Lowe&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were destined never to meet,&rdquo; she said, trying to
laugh softly; and in spite of herself her voice broke, as though
sadly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, quietly, &ldquo;we were destined not to
meet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fatality of meeting is sometimes very strange,&rdquo; she
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are thousands and millions, in our
lives&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think that we often, day after day, for
months on end, pass quite close to somebody&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody who, if we met him or her, would influence our
lives?&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s what I mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m certain of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s curious to think of&#8202;&hellip;. In the street,
sometimes, one&rsquo;s always meeting the same people, without knowing
them.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb176" href="#pb176" name=
"pb176">176</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know what you mean. In New York, when I was a
tram-driver, there was a woman who always got into my car; and, without
being in love with her, I used to think I should like to speak to her,
to know her, to meet her&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how often it is the other way round! I have met thousands
of people and forgotten their names and what they said to me. They were
like ghosts. That is how we meet people in society.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s all so futile&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You exchange names, exchange a few sentences &hellip; and
nothing remains, not the slightest
recollection&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it all vanishes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was so often tired &hellip; of so many people, so many
ghosts&#8202;&hellip;. I couldn&rsquo;t live like that now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet you have remained a society-woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, I am no longer that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she told him how she had once thought of making her reappearance
in Hague society; she told him about Van Naghel and Bertha.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you on bad terms with your sister now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not on bad terms&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He died suddenly&#8202;&hellip;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, quite suddenly. They had just had a
dinner-party&#8202;&hellip;. It was a terrible blow for my sister. And
I hear there are serious financial difficulties. It is all very
sad&#8202;&hellip;. But this doesn&rsquo;t interest you. Tell me about
yourself.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb177" href="#pb177"
name="pb177">177</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It interests me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me about your own life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just been telling you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, about Rome and Brussels. Now tell me about
Buitenzorg.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why about that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The childhood of my friends&mdash;I hope I may number you
among my friends?&mdash;always interests me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About Buitenzorg? I don&rsquo;t remember
anything&#8202;&hellip;. I was a little girl&#8202;&hellip;. There was
nothing in particular&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your brother Gerrit&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned pale, but he did not see it, in the dim room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What has he been saying?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your brother Gerrit remembers it all. The other night, after
your dinner here, he told me about it while we were smoking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gerrit?&rdquo; she said, anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes: how prettily you used to play on the great boulders in
the river&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She flushed scarlet, in the friendly dusk:</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s mad!&rdquo; she said, harshly. &ldquo;What does he
want to talk about that for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laughed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mayn&rsquo;t he? He idolizes you &hellip; and he idolized you
at that time&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb178" href="#pb178" name="pb178">178</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s always teasing me with those
reminiscences&#8202;&hellip;. They&rsquo;re ridiculous now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I&rsquo;m old. Those memories are pretty enough when
you are young&#8202;&hellip;. When you grow older, you let them sleep
&hellip; in the dead, silent years. For, when you&rsquo;re old, they
become ridiculous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her voice sounded hard. He was silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think I&rsquo;m right?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; he said, very gently. &ldquo;Perhaps you are
right. But it is a pity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; she forced herself to ask.</p>
<p>He gave a very deep sigh:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because it reminds us of all that we lose as we grow older
&hellip; even the right to our memories.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The right to our memories,&rdquo; she echoed almost under her
breath. And, in a firmer voice, she repeated, severely,
&ldquo;Certainly. When we grow older, we lose our right&#8202;&hellip;.
There are memories to which we lose our right as we grow
old&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is it hard for a woman to
grow old?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she answered, softly. &ldquo;I
believe that I shall grow old, that I am growing old as it is, without
finding it hard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;re not old,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am forty-three,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;and my son is
fourteen.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb179" href="#pb179"
name="pb179">179</a>]</span></p>
<p>She was determined to show herself no mercy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now tell me about yourself,&rdquo; she went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should I?&rdquo; he asked, almost dejectedly. &ldquo;You
would never understand me, however long I spoke. No, I can&rsquo;t
speak about myself to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not only to-day: it&rsquo;s very often.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, very often. The idea suddenly comes to me &hellip; that
everything has been of no use. That I have done nothing that was worth
while. That my life ought to have been quite different &hellip; to be
worth while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by worth while?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Worth while for people, for humanity. It always obsessed me,
after my games in the woods. You remember my telling you how I used to
play in the woods?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, very softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; he suddenly broke in. &ldquo;Are those
memories to which I have no right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a man,&rdquo; said she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have I more right to memories, as a man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not &hellip; to these?&rdquo; she said, softly.
&ldquo;They do not make your years ridiculous &hellip; as mine do
mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you so much afraid &hellip; of ridicule?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, frankly. &ldquo;I am as unwilling to be
ashamed in my own eyes &hellip; as in those of the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you abdicate&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb180" href="#pb180" name="pb180">180</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;My youth,&rdquo; she said, gently.</p>
<p>He was silent. Then he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I interrupted myself just now. I meant to tell you that,
after my games as a child, it was always my obsession &hellip; to be
something. To be somebody. To be a man. To be a man among men. That was
when I was a boy of sixteen or seventeen. Afterwards, at the
university, I was amazed at the childishness of Hans and Van Vreeswijck
and the others. They never thought; I was always
thinking&#8202;&hellip;. I worked hard, I wanted to know everything.
When I knew a good deal, I said to myself, &lsquo;Why go on learning
all this that others have thought out? Think things out for
yourself!&rsquo; &hellip; Then I had a feeling of utter
helplessness&#8202;&hellip;. But I&rsquo;m boring you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said, impatiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I felt utterly helpless&#8202;&hellip;. Then I said to
myself, &lsquo;If you can&rsquo;t think things out, <i>do</i>
something. Be somebody. Be a man. Work!&rsquo; &hellip; Then I read
Marx, Fourier, Saint-Simon: do you know them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never read them,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;but
I&rsquo;ve heard their names often enough to follow you. Go
on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I had read them, I started thinking, I thought a great
deal &hellip; and then I wanted to work. As a labourer. So as to
understand all those who were destitute&#8202;&hellip;. God, how
difficult words are! I simply can&rsquo;t speak to you about
myself.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb181" href="#pb181" name=
"pb181">181</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;And about Peace you speak &hellip; as if you were
inspired!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About Peace &hellip; perhaps, but not about myself. I went to
America, I became a workman. But the terrible thing was that I felt I
was <i>not</i> a workman. I had money. I gave it all to the poor
&hellip; nearly. But I kept just enough never to be hungry, to live a
little more comfortably than my mates, to take a day&rsquo;s rest when
I was tired, to buy meat and wine and medicines when I wanted them
&hellip; to go to the theatre dressed as a gentleman. Do you
understand? I was a Sunday workman. I was an amateur labourer. I
remained a gentleman, a &lsquo;toff.&rsquo; I come of a good
middle-class family: well, over there, in America, while I was a
workman, I remained&mdash;I became even more than I had been&mdash;an
aristocrat. I felt that I was far above my fellow-workmen. I knew more
than they, I knew a great deal: they could tell it by listening to me.
I was finer-grained, more delicately constituted than they: they could
tell it by looking at me. They regarded me as a wastrel who had been
kicked out of doors, who had &lsquo;seen better days;&rsquo; but they
continued to think me a gentleman and I myself felt a gentleman, a
&lsquo;toff.&rsquo; I never became a proper workman. I should have
liked to, so as to understand the workman thoroughly and afterwards, in
the light of my knowledge, to work for his welfare, back in my own
country, in my own station of life. But, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb182" href="#pb182" name="pb182">182</a>]</span>though I was living
among working people, I did not understand them. I shuddered
involuntarily at their jokes, their oaths, their drinking, their
friendship even. I remained a gentleman, a &lsquo;toff.&rsquo; I
remained of a different blood and a different culture. My ideas and my
theories would have had me resemble my mates; but all my former
life&mdash;my birth, my upbringing, my education&mdash;all my own and
my parents&rsquo; past, all my inherited instincts were against it. I
simply could not fraternize with them. I kept on trying something
different, thinking it was that that was amiss: a different sort of
work, a different occupation. Nothing made any difference. I remained a
harmless, inquisitive amateur; and just that settled conviction, that I
could leave off at any time if I wished, was the reason why my life
never became the profoundly serious thing which I would have had it. It
remained amateurish. It became almost a mockery of the life of my
mates. I was free and they were slaves. I was vigorous and they were
worked to death. To me, after my brain-work, that manual and muscular
labour came as a tonic. If I was overtired, I rested, left my job,
looked for something else after a few weeks. The others would be
sweated, right up to their old age, till they had yielded the last
ounce of their working-power. I should work just as long as I took
pleasure in it. I looked healthy and well, even though my face and
hands became rough. I ate in proportion <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb183" href="#pb183" name="pb183">183</a>]</span>to the hardness of my
work. And I thought: if they could all eat as I do, it would be all
right. Then I felt ashamed of myself, distributed all my money,
secretly, among the poor and lived solely on my wages &hellip; until I
fell ill &hellip; and cured myself with my money. It became absurd. And
never more so than when I, habitually well-fed, looked down upon my
mates because their unalterable ideal appeared to be &hellip; to eat
beef every day! Do they long for nothing better and higher and nobler,
I thought, than to eat beef? It was easy for me to think like that and
look down on them, I who ate beef whenever I wanted to! Well-fed, even
though tired with my work, I could think of nobler things than beef.
And yet &hellip; and yet, though I felt all this at the time, I still
continued to despise them for their base ideal. That was because of my
blood and my birth, but especially because of my superior training and
education. And then I became very despondent and thought, &lsquo;I
shall never feel myself their brother; I shall remain a gentleman, a
&ldquo;toff;&rdquo; it is not my fault: it is the fault of everything,
of all my past life.&rsquo; &hellip; Then, suddenly, without any
transition, I went back to Europe. I have lectured here &hellip; on
Peace. In a year&rsquo;s time, perhaps, I shall be lecturing on War. I
am still seeking. I no longer know anything. Properly speaking, I never
did know anything. I seek and seek&#8202;&hellip;. But why have I
talked to you at such length about myself? I <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb184" href="#pb184" name="pb184">184</a>]</span>am
ashamed of myself, I am ashamed. Perhaps I have no right to go on
seeking. A man seeks when he is young, does he not? When he has come to
my age, which is the same as yours, he ought to have found and he has
no right to go on seeking. And, if he hasn&rsquo;t found, then he looks
back upon his life as one colossal failure, as one huge
mistake&mdash;mistake upon mistake&mdash;and then things become
hopeless, hopeless, hopeless&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was silent&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>She thought of her own life, her small feminine life&mdash;the life
of a small soul that had not thought and had not felt, that was only
just beginning to feel and only just beginning at rare intervals to
think&mdash;and she saw her own small life also wasting the years in
mistake upon mistake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he said, in a voice filled with longing, &ldquo;to
have found what one might have gone on seeking for years! To have
found, when young, happiness &hellip; for one&rsquo;s self &hellip; and
for others! Oh, to be young, to be once more young!&hellip; And then to
seek &hellip; and then to find when young &hellip; and to <i>meet</i>
when young &hellip; and to be happy when young and to make
others&mdash;everybody!&mdash;happy!&hellip; To be young, oh, to be
young!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you are not old,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You are in the
prime of life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hate that phrase,&rdquo; he said, gloomily. &ldquo;The
prime of life occurs at my age in people who do not <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb185" href="#pb185" name=
"pb185">185</a>]</span>seek, but who have quietly travelled a definite,
known path. Those are the people who, when they are my age, are in the
prime of life. I am not: I have sought; I have never found. I now feel
all the sadness of my wasted efforts; I now feel &hellip; old. I feel
old. What more can I do now? Think a little more; try to keep abreast
of modern thought and modern conditions; seek a little, like a blind
man. And,&rdquo; with a bitter laugh, &ldquo;I have even lost that
right: the right to seek. You seek only when you are very young, or
else it becomes absurd.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are echoing me,&rdquo; she said, in gentle reproach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you were right, you were right. It is so. There is
nothing left, at our age; not even our
memories&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our memories,&rdquo; she murmured, very softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The memories of our childhood&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of our childhood,&rdquo; she repeated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not even that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not even that,&rdquo; she repeated, as though hypnotized.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, there is nothing left &hellip; for
us&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The door opened suddenly: they started.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mamma, are you there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Addie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, my boy&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see you. It is quite dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And here is Mr. Brauws.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb186" href="#pb186" name="pb186">186</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I can see nothing and nobody. May I light one of the
lamps?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He bustled through the room, hunted for matches, lit a lamp in the
corner:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it. Now at least I can see you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He came nearer: a young, handsome, bright boy, with his
good-looking, healthy face and his serious, blue eyes; broad and
strong, shedding a note of joy in the melancholy room, which lit up
softly with the glow of its one lamp, behind Constance. She smiled at
him, drew him down beside her, put her arms round him while he kissed
her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>He</i> is left!&rdquo; she said, softly, with a glance at
Brauws, referring to the last words which he had spoken.</p>
<p>He understood:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he answered&mdash;and his gloom seemed suddenly
to brighten into a sort of rueful gladness, a yearning hope that all
was not yet lost, that his dreams might be realized not by myself, but
by another, by Addie&mdash;and he repeated her own, radiant words,
&ldquo;Yes, yes, <i>he</i> is left!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy did not understand, looked at them both by turns and smiled
enquiringly, receiving only their smiles in answer&#8202;&hellip;.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">For a long time, Constance had not been to Mamma van
Lowe&rsquo;s Sunday-evenings; and at first Mamma had not insisted. Now,
however, one afternoon, she said, gently:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you never coming again on a Sunday, Constance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She saw that her mother had suddenly become very nervous and she was
sorry that she had not made an effort and overcome her reluctance to
attend the family-gatherings after that terrible evening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mamma,&rdquo; she said, without hesitation, &ldquo;I
will come. This is Saturday: I will come to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old woman leant back wearily in her chair, nodded her head up
and down, as though she knew all sorts of sad things:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is so sad &hellip; about Van Naghel,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;Bertha is going through a lot of trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It seemed as if Mamma wished to talk about it; but Constance, with
an affected indifference to her relations&rsquo; affairs, asked no
questions.</p>
<p>The next evening, Constance and Addie were ready to start for the
Alexanderstraat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you coming?&rdquo; she asked Van der Welcke.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb188" href="#pb188" name=
"pb188">188</a>]</span></p>
<p>He hesitated. He would rather not go, feeling unfriendly towards the
whole family, but he would have liked to see Marianne. Still he
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I think not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was afraid that his refusal would cause a scene; but latterly,
even though anger welled up inside her, she had shown a forbearance
which surprised him; and she merely said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mamma would like us all to come again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was really fond of the old lady: she had always been kind to
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who will be there?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, all of them!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;As
usual.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely not Bertha &hellip; and her
children&#8202;&hellip;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so,&rdquo; she said, gently, feeling that he was
sounding her to see if Marianne would be there. &ldquo;Why
shouldn&rsquo;t they go, though they are in mourning? It&rsquo;s not a
party: there will be no one but the family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I&rsquo;ll come on later,&rdquo; he said, still
hesitating.</p>
<p>She did not insist, went off on foot with Addie. It was curious, but
now, whenever she went to her mother&rsquo;s house, nice though her
mother always was to her, she felt as if she were going there as a
stranger, not as a daughter. It was because of the others that she felt
like a stranger, because of Bertha, Adolphine, Karel, Cateau and
Dorine. Gerrit and Paul were the only ones whom she still looked upon
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb189" href="#pb189" name=
"pb189">189</a>]</span>as brothers; and she was very fond of
Adeline.</p>
<p>This evening again, as she entered the room, she felt like that,
like a stranger. The old aunts were sitting in their usual places,
doing their crochet-work mechanically. Mamma, as Constance knew, had
had an angry scene with the two old things, to explain to them that
they mustn&rsquo;t talk scandal and, above all, that they mustn&rsquo;t
do so out loud, a scene which had thoroughly upset Mamma herself and
which the old aunts had not even seemed to understand, for they merely
nodded a vague consent, nodded yes, yes, no doubt Marie was right. Yet
Constance suspected that Auntie Rine had understood at least something
of it, for she was now looking at Constance askance, with a frightened
look. Constance could not bring herself to speak to the old aunts: she
walked past them; and Auntie Tine whispered to Auntie Rine:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There she is again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; screamed Auntie Rine, aloud.</p>
<p>But Auntie Tine dared not whisper anything more, because of their
sister Marie, who had flown into such a passion; and she pinched Auntie
Rine&rsquo;s withered hand, whereupon Auntie Rine glared at her
angrily. Then they cackled together for a moment, bad-temperedly. The
three young Saetzemas, playing their cards in a corner of the
conservatory, sat bursting with laughter at the bickering of the two
old aunts.</p>
<p>Constance sat down quietly by Mamma. And she <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb190" href="#pb190" name=
"pb190">190</a>]</span>felt, now that Addie spoke to
Marietje&mdash;Adolphine&rsquo;s Marietje&mdash;but did not go to the
boys in the conservatory, that there was no harmony among them all and
that they only met for the sake of Mamma, of Grandmamma. Poor Mamma!
And yet she did not seem to notice it, was glad that the children and
grandchildren came to her Sundays, to her
&ldquo;family-group.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Adolphine and Cateau sat talking in a corner; and Constance caught
what they said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;So Ber-tha is <i>not</i> &hellip; keep-ing on the
house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think not, indeed! They have nothing but
debts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it their bro-ther-in-law who is see-ing to things and
ad-min-istering the es-tate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, the commissary in Overijssel.&rdquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e4544src" href="#xd26e4544" name="xd26e4544src">1</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;So they are <i>not</i> well <i>off</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, they haven&rsquo;t a farthing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, as I al-ways used to say to Ka-rel, they al-ways lived
on much too <i>large</i> a <i>scale</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They squandered all they had.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s not very pleas-ant for the
children!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. And there&rsquo;s Emilie, who wants a divorce. But
don&rsquo;t mention that to Mamma: she doesn&rsquo;t know about
it.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb191" href="#pb191" name=
"pb191">191</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Ve-ry well&#8202;&hellip;. Yes, that&rsquo;s most
unfor-tunate. Your Floor-tje, Phine, is bet-ter off than that with
Dij-kerhof.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At least, they&rsquo;re not thinking of getting divorced. I
always look upon a divorce as a scandal. We&rsquo;ve one divorce in the
family as it is; and I consider that one too many.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Constance turned pale and felt that Adolphine was speaking loud on
purpose, though it was behind her back&#8202;&hellip;. Dear Mamma
noticed nothing!&hellip; She had been much upset on that one Sunday,
that terrible evening, but had not really understood the truth: the
terrible thing to her was merely that the old sisters had talked so
loud and so spitefully about her poor Constance, like the
cross-grained, spiteful old women that they were; but what happened
besides she had really never quite known&#8202;&hellip;. And this, now
that Constance was gradually drawing farther away from her brothers and
sisters, suddenly struck her as rather fine. Whatever happened, they
kept Mamma out of it as far as they could, in a general filial
affection for Mamma, in a filial conspiracy to leave Mamma her
happiness and her illusion about the family; and it seemed as if the
brothers and sisters also impressed this on their children; it appeared
that Adolphine even taught it to her loutish boys, for, to her sudden
surprise, she saw Chris and Piet go up to Addie and ask him to join in
their game. Addie refused, coldly; and now <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb192" href="#pb192" name=
"pb192">192</a>]</span>Constance was almost ashamed that she herself
had not pointed out to Addie that Grandmamma must always be spared and
left in her fond illusion that all was harmony. But fortunately Addie
of his own accord always knew what was the right thing to do; for, when
Adolphine&rsquo;s Marietje also came up with a smile and asked him to
come and play cards in the conservatory, he went with her at once. She
smiled because of it all: no, there was no mutual sympathy, but there
was a general affection for Mamma. A general affection, for Mamma, was
something rather touching after all; and really she had never before
seen it in that light, as something fine, that strong and really
unanimous feeling among all those different members of a family whose
interests and inclinations in the natural course of things were
divided. Yes, now that she was standing farther away from her brothers
and sisters, she saw for the first time this one feature which was good
in them. Yes, it was really something very good, something lovable; and
even Adolphine had it&#8202;&hellip;. It was as though a softer mood
came over Constance, no longer one of criticism and resentment, but
rather of sympathy and understanding, in which bitterness had given
place to kindliness; and in that softer mood there was still indeed
sadness, but no anger, as if everything could not well be other than it
was, in their circle of small people, of very small people, whose eyes
saw only a little way beyond themselves, whose <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb193" href="#pb193" name=
"pb193">193</a>]</span>hearts were sensitive only a little way beyond
themselves, not farther than the narrow circle of their children and
perhaps their children&rsquo;s children&#8202;&hellip;. She did not
know why, but, in the vague sadness of this new, softer mood, she
thought of Brauws. And, though not able at once to explain why, she
connected her thought of him with this kindlier feeling of hers, this
deeper, truer vision of things around her. And, as though new,
far-stretching vistas opened up before her, she suddenly seemed to be
contemplating life, that life which she had never yet contemplated. A
new, distant horizon lay open before her, a distant circle, a wide
circle round the narrow little circle past which the eyes of her soul
had never yet been able to gaze&#8202;&hellip;. It was strange to her,
this feeling, here in this room, in this family-circle. It was as
though she suddenly saw all her relations&mdash;the Ruyvenaers had now
arrived as well&mdash;sitting and talking in that room, all her
relations and herself also, as very small people, who sat and talked,
who moved and lived and thought in a very narrow little circle of
self-interest, while outside that circle the horizon extended ever
wider and wider, like a vision of great cloudy skies, under which towns
rose sharply, seas billowed, bright lightning glanced. It all shot
through her and in front of her very swiftly: two or three little
revealing flashes, no more; swift revelations, which flashed out and
then darkened again. But, swiftly though those revelations <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb194" href="#pb194" name="pb194">194</a>]</span>had
flashed, after that brightness the room remained small, those people
remained small, she herself remained small&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>She herself had never lived: oh, she had so often suspected it! But
those other people: had they also never, never lived? Mamma, in the
narrow circle of her children&rsquo;s and grandchildren&rsquo;s
affection; Uncle and Aunt, in their interests as sugar-planters; Karel
and Cateau, in their narrow, respectable, complacent comfort;
Adolphine, in her miserable struggle for social importance; and the
others, Gerrit, Dorine, Ernst, Paul: had they ever, ever lived? Her
husband: had he ever lived? Or was it all just a mere existence, as she
herself had existed; a vegetation rooted in little thoughts and habits,
in little opinions and prejudices, in little religions or philosophies;
and feeling pleasant and comfortable therein and looking down upon and
condemning others and considering one&rsquo;s self fairly good and
fairly high-minded, not so bad as others and at least far more sensible
in one&rsquo;s opinions and beliefs than most of one&rsquo;s
neighbours?&hellip; Oh, people like themselves; people in their
&ldquo;set,&rdquo; in other sets, with their several variations of
birth, religion, position, money; decent people, whom Brauws sometimes
called &ldquo;the <i>bourgeois</i>:&rdquo; had they ever lived, ever
looked out beyond the very narrow circle which their dogmas drew around
them? What a small and insignificant merry-go-round it was! And what
was the object <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb195" href="#pb195" name=
"pb195">195</a>]</span>of whirling among one another and round one
another like that?&hellip; It suddenly appeared to her that, of all
these people who belonged to her and of all the others, the
acquaintances, whom with a swift mental effort she grouped around them,
there was not one who could send a single thought shining out far and
wide, towards the wide horizons yonder, without thinking of himself,
his wife and his children and clinging to his prejudices about money,
position, religion and birth&#8202;&hellip;. As regards money, it was
almost a distinction among all of them not to have any and then to live
as if they had. Position was what they strove for; and those who did
not strive for it, such as Paul and Ernst, were criticized for their
weakness. Religion was, with those other people, the mere
acquaintances, not belonging to their circle, sometimes a matter of
decency or of political interest; but, in their set, with its
East-Indian leaven, it was ignored, quietly and calmly, never thought
about or talked about, save that the children were just confirmed,
quickly, as they might be given a dancing- or music-lesson. Birth,
birth, that was everything; and even then there was that superior
contempt for new titles of nobility, that respect only for old titles
and a tendency to think themselves very grand, even though they were
not titled, as members of a patrician Dutch-Indian family which, in
addition to its original importance, had also absorbed the importance
attaching to the highest <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb196" href=
"#pb196" name="pb196">196</a>]</span>official positions in
Java&#8202;&hellip;. And over it all lay the soft smile of indulgent
pity and contempt for any who thought differently from themselves. It
formed the basis of all their opinions, however greatly those opinions
might vary according to their personal interests and views: compassion
and contempt for people who had no money and lived economically; for
those who did not aim at an exalted position; for those, whether
Catholics or anti-revolutionaries&mdash;they themselves were all
moderate liberals, with special emphasis on the
&ldquo;moderate&rdquo;&mdash;who cherished an enthusiasm for religion;
for those who were not of such patrician birth as themselves. And so
on, with certain variations in these opinions&#8202;&hellip;. It was as
though Constance noticed the merry-go-round for the first time,
whirling in that little circle. It was as though she saw it in the
past, saw it whirling in their drawing-rooms, when her father was still
alive, then especially. She saw it suddenly, as a child, after it is
grown up, sees its parents and their house, their former life, in which
it was a child, in which it grew up. She saw it now like that at her
mother&rsquo;s, only less vividly, because of the informality of that
family-gathering. She saw it like that, dimly, in all, in every one of
them, more or less. But she also saw the respect, the love for Mamma,
the wish to leave her in the illusion which that love gave her.</p>
<p>She had never seen it like that before. She herself <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb197" href="#pb197" name="pb197">197</a>]</span>was
just the same as the others. And she thought herself and all of them
small, so small that she said to herself:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do we all of us live for so very little, when there is so
very much beyond, stretching far and wide, under the cloudy skies of
that immense horizon? Do we never stop outside this little circle in
which we all, with our superior smile&mdash;because we are so
distinguished and enlightened&mdash;spin round one another and
ourselves, like humming-tops, like everlasting humming-tops?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And again Brauws&rsquo; figure rose before her eyes. Oh, she now for
the first time understood what he had said, on that first evening when
she saw and heard him, about Peace!&hellip; Peace! The pure, immaculate
ideal suddenly streamed before her like a silver banner, fluttered in
the wide cloudy skies! Oh, she now for the first time understood
&hellip; why he sought. He had wanted to seek &hellip; life! He had
sought &hellip; and he had not found. But, while seeking, he had lived:
he still lived! His breath came and went, his pulses throbbed, his
chest heaved &hellip; even though his sadness, because he had never
&ldquo;found,&rdquo; bedimmed his energies. But she and all of them did
not live! They did not live, they had never lived. They were born,
people of distinction, with all their little cynicisms about money and
religion, with all their fondness for birth and position; and they
continued to spin round like that, to <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb198" href="#pb198" name="pb198">198</a>]</span>spin like
humming-tops: moderate liberals. That they all tolerated her again, in
the little circle, was that not all part of their moderate liberal
attitude? Oh, to live, to live really, to live as he had lived, to live
&hellip; to live with him!</p>
<p>She was now startled at herself. She was in a room full of people
and she sat in silence next to her mother. Dear Mamma!&hellip; And she
was weary of her own thinking, for swift as lightning it all flashed
through her, that revelation of her thoughts, without sentences,
without images, without words. It just flashed; and that was all. But
that flashing made her feel weary, enervated, almost breathless in the
room, which she found close&#8202;&hellip;. And the very last of her
thoughts, which had just for a moment appeared before
her&mdash;sentence, image and word&mdash;had startled her. She had to
confess it to herself: she loved, she loved him. But she inwardly
pronounced that love&mdash;perhaps with the little cynical laugh which
she had observed in her own people&mdash;she pronounced that love to be
absurd, because so many silent, dead years lay heaped up there, because
she was old, quite old. To wish to live at this time of day was absurd.
To wish to dream at this stage was absurd. No, after so many years had
been wasted on that meaningless existence, then she, an old woman now,
must not hope to live again when it dawned too late, that life of
thinking and feeling, that life from which might have sprung
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb199" href="#pb199" name=
"pb199">199</a>]</span>a life of doing and loving, of boundless love,
of love for everybody and everything&#8202;&hellip;. No, after so many
years had been spent in living the life of a plant, until the plant
became yellow and sere, then inevitably, inexorably extinction, slow
extinction, was the only hope that remained&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>The absurdity, of being so old&mdash;forty-three&mdash;and feeling
like that!&hellip; Never, she swore, would she allow anybody to
perceive that absurdity. She knew quite well that it was not really
absurd, that its absurdity existed only in the narrow little circle of
little prejudices and little dogmas. But she also knew that she, like
all of them, was small, that she herself was full of prejudice; she
knew that she could not rise, could never rise above what she
considered absurd, what she had been taught, from a child, in her
little circle, to look upon as absurd!</p>
<p>No, now that she was old, there was nothing for her but to turn her
eyes from the radiant vision and, calmly, to grow still older &hellip;
to go towards that slow extinction which perhaps would still drag on
for many long and empty years: the years of a woman of her age &hellip;
in their set&#8202;&hellip;. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb200" href=

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The door opened and Bertha, Louise and Marianne
entered. And they stepped so suddenly right across Constance&rsquo;
thoughts that she was startled at their appearance: mother and
daughters in deep mourning. She had not seen Bertha except on that
first hurried visit immediately after Van Naghel&rsquo;s death and on
the day of the funeral, six weeks ago; and she knew very little of what
was happening; she had seen Marianne only once. And now that they both
stepped right across her thoughts, into that narrow circle&mdash;which
she condemned, though she herself was unable to move out of it&mdash;a
great compassion suddenly surged through her, like a torrent. Bertha
looked very pale, tired, wasted, grown all at once into an old woman,
hopeless and resigned, as though broken under much silent sorrow.
Louise&rsquo;s face wore a rather more tranquil expression; but
Marianne beside her, delicate and white, still more delicate and white
in her black dress, also diffused an almost tearful melancholy. Mamma
rose and went towards them. It was the first time since her
husband&rsquo;s death that Bertha had come to Mamma&rsquo;s
Sunday-evening; and the gesture with which the old woman rose,
approached her daughter, embraced her and led her to the sofa where she
had been sitting <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb201" href="#pb201"
name="pb201">201</a>]</span>showed the same open-armed and open-hearted
motherly affection with which, as Constance remembered, Mamma had
received her, Constance, at the door, on the landing, on the first
evening of her own return. Dear Mamma!</p>
<p>It touched her so much that she herself rose, went to Bertha, kissed
her tenderly, kissed Louise and Marianne. Her voice, for the first time
for many a day, had a sisterly note in it that took Bertha by surprise.
She pressed Constance&rsquo; hand and, after the others had spoken to
her, sat down quietly near Mamma, Aunt Lot and Constance. How pale,
dejected and resigned she was! She seemed to be looking helplessly
around her, to be looking for some one to assist her, to be wishing to
say something, to somebody, that would have relieved her. She
sighed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have come, Mamma &hellip; but I cannot stay long,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;I am very tired. There are all those business matters;
and, though Adolph is very kind and sympathetic and is a great help, it
is terribly complicated and I sometimes feel half-dead with it
all&#8202;&hellip;. It&rsquo;s lucky that I have Otto and Frances; I
don&rsquo;t know what I should do without them&#8202;&hellip;. You know
we are going to live in the country?&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were thinking about it the other day, dear,&rdquo; said
Mamma, anxiously, &ldquo;but it wasn&rsquo;t decided yet &hellip;
Bertha, <i>must</i> I lose you?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb202" href="#pb202" name="pb202">202</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear Mamma, it&rsquo;s better in the country. Adolph wanted
us to look round in Overijssel, but I would rather be at Baarn, for
instance: it&rsquo;s nearer to the Hague and
you&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Baarn, my child? There&rsquo;s nobody there but
Amsterdam people, business-people: such a very different set from
ours!&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t expect to make friends, Mamma, at
first. I shall be alone with the girls. Otto and Frances have found a
little house at the Hague: it&rsquo;s lucky that Otto is provided for
at the Foreign Office. The minister spoke very nicely about him the
other day&#8202;&hellip;. Frans and Henri must finish their
university-course quickly now,&rdquo; she said, in a hesitating tone.
&ldquo;Karel is going to a boarding-school, for I can&rsquo;t manage
him. And Marietje too: she was going soon, in any case. So there will
be just the three of us: Louise, Marianne and I&#8202;&hellip;. Things
have changed very much, all at once, Aunt Lot. We want to live quietly.
In the first place, we shall just have to live quietly; and the girls
are quite content to do so&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It again seemed to Constance as if Bertha were looking for somebody
in the room, were hushing something up. Constance had Emilie&rsquo;s
name on her lips, but she did not like to ask. Mamma knew nothing more
than that Emilie and Van Raven sometimes had differences.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall have a lot of trouble and worry before <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb203" href="#pb203" name=
"pb203">203</a>]</span>me,&rdquo; said Bertha. &ldquo;But, when it is
all settled and we have our little villa&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She sank back in her chair and stared before her with dim eyes.</p>
<p>Constance took her hand compassionately, held it tight. It looked as
though Bertha, after that busy life which had suddenly snapped with Van
Naghel&rsquo;s death, an hour after their last dinner-party, no longer
knew what to do or say, felt derelict and helpless&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>Though there was so much business to attend to, she seemed stunned
all at once, in the grip of a strange lethargy, as though everything
was now finished, as though there was nothing left now that there would
soon be no more visits to pay, no receptions to hold, no dinners to
give; now that Van Naghel no longer came home from the Chamber, tired
and irritable from an afternoon&rsquo;s heckling; now that there would
be no more calculating how they could manage to spend a thousand
guilders less a month; now that she would simply have to live quietly
on what she and the girls possessed. And it seemed as if she no longer
knew how or why she should go on living, now that she would no longer
have to give her dinners and pay her visits &hellip; for her children,
particularly her girls. Louise and Marianne had said to her so calmly
that they wanted very soon to begin living quietly that Bertha now
began to wonder: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb204" href="#pb204"
name="pb204">204</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did I always make so much fuss, if the girls cared for it
so little? Why did I go on till I was old and worn out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was true, that had been Van Naghel&rsquo;s ambition: he had
wanted to see his house a political <i>salon</i>. What he wished had
happened. Now it was all over. Now there was nothing to be done but to
live quietly, in the little villa at Baarn; to make no debts; to let
the boys finish their college-course as quickly as possible; and then
to educate Karel and Marietje and let theirs be a different life from
the others&rsquo;: how she did not know&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>Bertha remained sitting wearily, staring vaguely before her,
half-listening to the sympathetic words, uttered with an emphatic
Indian accent, of Aunt Lot, who kept saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Kassian!&hellip;</i>&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e4665src" href="#xd26e4665" name="xd26e4665src">1</a></p>
<p>But suddenly an access of nervousness seemed to startle her out of
her depression. She looked round again, as though seeking for somebody
&hellip; somebody to say something to. Her glance fastened for a moment
on Aunt Lot and then on Constance. Suddenly she rose, with a little
laugh, as though she wanted to speak to Louise, farther away. But the
nervous pressure of her hand seemed to be urging Constance also to get
up, to go with her, somewhere, anywhere&#8202;&hellip;. They went
through the other drawing-room, past the card-table at which
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb205" href="#pb205" name=
"pb205">205</a>]</span>Uncle, Adolphine, Karel and Dotje were sitting,
past the other with Cateau, Van Saetzema, Dijkerhof and Pop; and the
conversation at both tables at once flagged; the cards fell hurriedly
one after the other&#8202;&hellip;. They were talking about Bertha,
thought Constance, as Bertha drew her gently to the little boudoir, the
room where the wine and cakes were set out, where Papa van Lowe&rsquo;s
portrait hung, stern and inexorable; the little room where they all of
them went when they had anything confidential to say to one another,
when there was a scene, or a difference, or a private discussion. And
Constance at once remembered how, five months ago, she had appealed to
Van Naghel and Bertha in this very room; how they had refused to
receive her &ldquo;officially&rdquo; at their house; how Van der Welcke
had lost his temper, flown into a rage, made a rush for Van
Naghel&#8202;&hellip;. She was now here with Bertha once more; and
Papa&rsquo;s portrait stared down coldly and severely upon the two
sisters.</p>
<p>They looked at each other in silence. Bertha glanced round timidly:
she felt that, in the big drawing-room, at the card-tables, the
brothers and sisters had at once begun to talk again, criticizing her,
because she had retired for a moment with Constance &hellip; with
Constance. And, lowering her voice to a hardly audible whisper, she
murmured:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Constance &hellip; Constance &hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, Bertha?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb206" href="#pb206" name="pb206">206</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Help me &hellip; help me &hellip; be kind to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh dear, nobody knows about it yet, but I can&rsquo;t keep it
all &hellip; here &hellip; to myself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me what it is and what I can do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you can do. But, Constance, I felt I
had to &hellip; had to &hellip; tell you&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody, nobody knows yet &hellip; except Louise and
Marianne.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Emilie &hellip; Emilie has&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has gone away &hellip; with
Henri&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Run away perhaps &hellip; with Henri&#8202;&hellip;. I
don&rsquo;t know where. Van Raven doesn&rsquo;t know where. Nobody
knows. Adolph van Naghel, my brother-in-law the commissary, has made
enquiries &hellip; and has found out nothing&#8202;&hellip;. We
dissuaded her from seeking a divorce; so did Adolph. Then, no doubt
because of that, she ran away with Henri, with her brother. She
absolutely refuses to live with Eduard. She has run
away&#8202;&hellip;. Constance, where has she gone to? I don&rsquo;t
know! Constance, it&rsquo;s a terrible thing! But keep it to yourself,
don&rsquo;t tell anybody. Mamma doesn&rsquo;t know. I want to pretend,
if there&rsquo;s nothing else for it, if they don&rsquo;t come back,
that she has gone on a little journey, a trip somewhere, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb207" href="#pb207" name=
"pb207">207</a>]</span>alone with her brother. We must pretend that,
Constance. I don&rsquo;t think they intend to come back. Henri has been
very excited lately: he fought Eduard, came to blows with him, for
ill-treating his sister. You know how fond they are of each other,
Emilie and Henri. It&rsquo;s almost unnatural, in a brother and sister.
Now they&rsquo;ve run away&#8202;&hellip;. Oh dear, Constance, I am so
terribly unhappy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She threw herself into Constance&rsquo; arms, sobbed, with her arms
round Constance&rsquo; neck:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Constance, Constance, help me!&hellip; I have no one to turn
to, no one I can talk to. Adolph is helping me with the
business-matters; Otto too. Louise is very kind; but she and Otto think
that Emilie ought to divorce her husband, on the ground of cruelty.
But, Constance, in our class, men don&rsquo;t beat their wives! It
never happens. It&rsquo;s an awful thing. It only happens with the
lower orders!&hellip; Oh dear, Constance, I am so unhappy!&hellip; The
business-matters will be settled&#8202;&hellip;. But there are debts. I
thought that we were living within our income, but I don&rsquo;t know:
there appear to be debts. Bills mount up so&#8202;&hellip;. I did so
hope that the boys would finish their course. Frans will; but now Henri
&hellip; that mad idea &hellip; going away with Emilie &hellip; running
away &hellip; nobody knows where&#8202;&hellip;. Oh dear, Constance, I
<i>am</i> so unhappy: help me, do help me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She lay back limply in Constance&rsquo; arms and the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb208" href="#pb208" name=
"pb208">208</a>]</span>tears flowed incessantly down her pale face,
which in those few weeks had fallen away till it was the face of an old
woman. She lay there feeble and ill; and it seemed as if Van
Naghel&rsquo;s death, coming suddenly as an additional catastrophe on
that evening of misfortunes&mdash;her guests in the drawing-room,
Emilie hiding upstairs, Van Raven waiting below&mdash;had so terribly
shaken her composure, the composure of a prudent, resourceful woman of
the world, that she was simply compelled to speak of private matters
which she would never have mentioned before&#8202;&hellip;. An instinct
drove her into Constance&rsquo; arms, drove her to unbosom herself to
Constance as the only one who could understand her. Her near-sighted,
blinking eyes sought anxiously, through her tears, to read the
expression on Constance&rsquo; face. And she was so broken, so
shattered that Constance had to make an effort to realize that it was
really Bertha whom she held in her arms.</p>
<p>The ill-feeling which she had cherished for months past was gone.
None of it remained in her soul, in her heart, as though she had passed
out of the depths of that atmosphere to purer heights of understanding
and feeling. Only for a moment did she still remember that evening when
she herself, in this same room, had implored Bertha and Van Naghel to
help her &ldquo;rehabilitate&rdquo; herself in the eyes of their
friends and of the Hague. It seemed long ago, years ago. She could
hardly understand herself: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb209" href=
"#pb209" name="pb209">209</a>]</span>that she could have begged so
earnestly for something that was so small, of such little importance to
her soul, to the world. She could not have done it now&#8202;&hellip;.
She did not understand how she could so long have cherished a grudge
against Van Naghel, against Bertha &hellip; because they did not ask
her to their official dinners, when the invitation would have given her
the rehabilitation which she sought. At the present moment, she did not
even desire that rehabilitation, did not care about it, treated it as
something that had become of no value: an idea which had withered and
shrivelled within her and which blew away like a dead leaf to far-off
spacious skies&#8202;&hellip;. Addie? He did not need his
mother&rsquo;s rehabilitation in the eyes of the Hague. The boy would
make his own way in life&#8202;&hellip;. Oh, how small she had been, to
beg for it; to go on bearing a grudge, months on end, for something so
little, so infinitesimal &hellip; so absolutely non-existent!&hellip;
She felt that something had grown up inside her and was looking down
upon all that earlier business&#8202;&hellip;. No, there was no
bitterness left. She felt a deep pity and a sisterly affection for this
poor, old woman, Bertha, who now lay feebly and impotently in her arms,
begging &hellip; for what? She collected her thoughts: what could she
do, how could she help Bertha? Her thoughts crowded upon one another
rapidly; she thought vaguely of Van der Welcke, of Addie: what could
they do, how could <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb210" href="#pb210"
name="pb210">210</a>]</span>they help Bertha, how get upon the track of
Emilie and Henri? And in the end she could think of nothing to say
but:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Bertha, the best thing will be to pretend that Emilie
has gone for a trip with her brother. We will put it like that, if
necessary. What does Van Raven want to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t consent to a divorce&#8202;&hellip;. And it
would be an awful thing, you know&#8202;&hellip;. Oh, Constance, they
have not been married ten months!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A weariness suddenly came over her, like the abrupt extinction of
all the little mundane interests that had always meant so much to
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;if he beats her &hellip;
perhaps it is better that they should be divorced&#8202;&hellip;. I
don&rsquo;t know&#8202;&hellip;. We are going to Baarn: there is a
small villa to let there. I should prefer to take it at once and go
down there with Louise and Marianne&#8202;&hellip;. Karel gives me a
lot of trouble: he doesn&rsquo;t behave well, no, he doesn&rsquo;t
behave well. And he is still so young. Perhaps he will go to live with
Adolph, his guardian, who will be very strict with him. I don&rsquo;t
know what to do, I can do nothing&#8202;&hellip;. I used to do
everything with Van Naghel, he and I together. He was really good and
kind. We were always thinking of the children, both of us. He was tired
&hellip; of being in the Cabinet; but he went on, for the
children&rsquo;s sake&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her unconscious simplicity, in implying that Van <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb211" href="#pb211" name=
"pb211">211</a>]</span>Naghel was in the Cabinet for the sake of his
children and not of his country, seemed to strike Constance for the
first time: she almost smiled, held Bertha closer to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He couldn&rsquo;t very well resign &hellip; and he
didn&rsquo;t want to,&rdquo; Bertha continued, feebly. &ldquo;And now I
don&rsquo;t know what to do. I feel so very much alone; and yet I was
once a capable woman, wasn&rsquo;t I, Constance? Now I no longer feel
capable. Perhaps that life was too crowded. And, Constance, what was
the use of it all? My children, our children, for whom we lived, are
none of them happy. I have grown weary and old &hellip; for nothing. I
wish that we were at Baarn now. I want to live there quietly, with the
two girls. Louise is nice, so is Marianne. They neither of them want to
go about any more. They&rsquo;re not happy, no, they are not happy. Oh,
my poor, poor children!&hellip; You must never tell Mamma, Constance.
Mamma doesn&rsquo;t know: dear Mamma! There is no need for her to know,
poor dear! Better leave her under the impression that all is well with
us, even though Van Naghel is gone&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she sobbed at the thought that she was alone. Then, suddenly,
she drew herself up a little, made Constance take a chair, sat down
beside her and asked, peering anxiously through her tears into
Constance&rsquo; face:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Constance, tell me &hellip; Marianne?&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb212" href="#pb212" name="pb212">212</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Bertha?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you fond of Marianne?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, very.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, still.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Constance&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Bertha?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is just as well &hellip; that we are going to
Baarn&#8202;&hellip;. Tell me, Constance: Van der
Welcke&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What sort of a man is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean, Bertha?&rdquo; asked Constance, gently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is &hellip; is it his fault?&hellip; Is he a
gentleman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Constance defended her husband calmly, but not without astonishment
that Bertha could speak so frankly about <i>that</i> &hellip; as if
they both knew all about it:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Bertha, I don&rsquo;t think that Henri &hellip; that it
is Henri&rsquo;s fault. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s Marianne&rsquo;s
fault either. Bertha, I don&rsquo;t believe they can help it. They have
an attraction for each other, a very great
attraction&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A tenderness came over her soul, like a glow, like a glowing
compassion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Constance, they must not let themselves go. They must
struggle against it.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb213" href=
"#pb213" name="pb213">213</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Who can tell what they are doing, Bertha? Who can tell what
goes on inside them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, they are not struggling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who can tell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no&#8202;&hellip;. Constance, it is just as well that we
are going to Baarn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They heard voices in the drawing-room, loud voices, with an Indian
accent. The Ruyvenaers were going:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye, Ber-r-rtha,&rdquo; said Aunt Lot, looking through
the door. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going, Ber-r-rtha.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Constance and Bertha went back to the drawing-room. Bertha forgot to
wipe the tears from her eyes, kissed Aunt Lot. Adolphine and Cateau
came up to Bertha:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ber-tha,&rdquo; whined Cateau; and this time she whined with
a vengeance. &ldquo;We just want-ed to say a <i>word</i> to you.
Emilie-tje must <i>not</i> get a di-vorce.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Adolphine, &ldquo;if she goes and gets a
divorce, the family will become impossible. It&rsquo;ll create a
scandal, if they are divorced.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye-es,&rdquo; Cateau droned aloud, &ldquo;it would be a
scan-dal, Ber-tha. Don&rsquo;t you think so <i>too</i>,
Constance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no question of it &hellip; for the
moment,&rdquo; said Constance. &ldquo;Emilie has gone abroad for a bit
with Henri; and the change is sure to do her good and make her a little
calmer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh?&hellip; Has she gone a-broad?&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb214" href="#pb214" name="pb214">214</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Where to?&rdquo; asked Adolphine, all agog.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were to go to Paris,&rdquo; said Constance, without
hesitating.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O-oh?&hellip; Has Emilie-tje gone to &hellip;
Pa-ris?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, with her brother,&rdquo; Constance repeated.</p>
<p>A minute later, she found an opportunity of saying quietly to
Bertha:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s better like that, Bertha; better to say it as if
it was quite natural&#8202;&hellip; If you don&rsquo;t say it yourself
&hellip; and they come to hear&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Constance &hellip; thank you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Bertha&#8202;&hellip;. I wish I could do something for
you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have helped me as it is&#8202;&hellip;. Thank
you&#8202;&hellip;. That&rsquo;s all that I can
say&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She lay back helplessly in her chair, staring dimly before her.
Constance followed her glance. She saw that Van der Welcke had come,
very late. He was sitting in the conservatory&mdash;where the boys had
cleared away the cards after their game, as Grandmamma always expected
them to do&mdash;sitting a little in the shadow, but still visible. He
was bending over towards Marianne, who sat beside him, her face a white
patch in the darkness: a frail little black figure making a faint blur
in the dim conservatory, where the gas was now turned out. She seemed
to be weeping silently, sat crushing her handkerchief. He appeared to
be saying something, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb215" href="#pb215"
name="pb215">215</a>]</span>anxiously and tenderly, while he bent still
nearer to her. Then, suddenly, he took her hand, pressed it
impulsively. Marianne looked up in alarm. Her eyes met, at the far end
of the long drawing-room, the eyes of Aunt Constance, the dull, staring
eyes of her mother. She drew away her hand &hellip; and her pale face
flushed with a glow of shame&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>Grandmamma stood in the middle of the drawing-room, a little sad at
the gloom which the recent mourning had cast over her rooms. The
children took their leave. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb216" href=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Constance began to love her loneliness more and
more.</p>
<p>Her daily life was very uneventful: she could count the people with
whom she came into contact. First her husband and her son: there was
something gentler in her attitude towards Van der Welcke, something
almost motherly, which prevented her from getting angry with him, even
though the inclination welled up within her. Addie was as usual,
perhaps even a little more serious: this disquieted her. Then there was
Brauws, who came regularly. He dined with them regularly, on a fixed
day in the week, quite informally; and moreover he had become the
friend of both Van der Welcke and Constance and even of Addie. Then
there were Mamma, Gerrit and his little tribe and, now and again, Paul.
And then there was Van Vreeswijck; and Marianne, of course; and
latterly she had seen more of Bertha. For the rest she seemed to drift
away from all the others, even from warm-hearted Aunt Lot. She kept in
touch only with those with whom she was really in sympathy.</p>
<p>Still, though she had these few friends, she often <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb217" href="#pb217" name="pb217">217</a>]</span>had
quite lonely afternoons. But they did not depress her; she gazed out at
the rain, at the cloud-phantoms. And she dreamed &hellip; along the
path of light. She smiled at her dream. Even though she very much
feared the absurdity of it for herself, she could not help it: a new
youthfulness filled her with a gentle glow, a new tenderness, like the
delicate bloom of a young girl&rsquo;s soul dreaming of the wonderful
future&#8202;&hellip;. And then she would come back to herself suddenly
and smile at her sentimentality and summon up all her matronly
common-sense; and she would think:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, I oughtn&rsquo;t to be sitting like this!&hellip; Come,
I oughtn&rsquo;t to be acting like this and thinking of everything and
nothing!&hellip; Certainly, I like him very much; but why cannot I do
that without these strange thoughts, without dreaming and picturing all
manner of things and filling my head with romantic fancies &hellip; as
if I were a girl of eighteen or twenty?&hellip; Oh, those are the
things which we do not speak about, the deep secret things which we
never tell to anybody!&hellip; I should never have suspected them in
myself &hellip; or that they could be so exquisitely sweet to me. How
strangely sweet, to dream myself back to youth in visions which, though
they never really take shape, yet make a shining path to those cloudy
skies, to imagine myself young again in those dreams!&hellip; If I
never had these thoughts and dreams before, why do I <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb218" href="#pb218" name="pb218">218</a>]</span>have
them now? Come, I oughtn&rsquo;t to be sitting like this and thinking
like this!&hellip; I make up a host of pretty stories, sentimental
little stories, and see myself, see us both, years ago, as quite young
children, both of us. He played and I played &hellip; almost the same
game: he a boy, I a girl. It was as though he were seeking me. It was
as though I, in my childish dreams, divined something of him, far, far
away, as though there were a part of me that wanted to go to him, a
part of him that wanted to come to me&#8202;&hellip;. Stop, I am giving
way again to those secret enthusiasms which lie deep down in my soul
like strange, hidden streams, those vague, romantic ferments such as I
imagined that young girls might have, but not I, a woman of my years, a
woman with my past, the mother of a big son&#8202;&hellip;. I will
<i>not</i> do it any more, I will <i>not</i>&hellip;. It is morbid to
be like this&#8202;&hellip;. And yet &hellip; and yet &hellip; when the
wind blows and the rain comes down, it <i>is</i>, it still is the dear
secret that brings the tears to my eyes&#8202;&hellip;. If I love him,
quite silently, deep down within myself, why may I not just dream like
that? The absurdity of it exists only for me: nobody, <i>nobody</i>
knows of it. I have some one else hidden within me: a younger woman, a
sister, a young sister-soul, a girl&rsquo;s soul almost. It is absurd,
I know; but sometimes, sometimes it is so strong in me and I love him
so well and feel, just like a girl, that <i>he</i> is the first man I
have ever loved&#8202;&hellip;. Oh, Henri! I can <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb219" href="#pb219" name="pb219">219</a>]</span>see
now what <i>that</i> was: he was young; it was at first mere
play-acting, just like a comedy; then it became passion, very quickly,
a mad impulse, an almost feverish impulse to hold him in my arms. That
is all dead. Passion is dead&#8202;&hellip;. This is a dream, a young
girl&rsquo;s dream. It is the beginning. It <i>is</i> absurd; and I am
often ashamed of it, for my own sake. But I cannot resist it: it
envelops me, just as the spring sunshine and the scent of the may and
the cherry-blossom in the Woods envelop one with languorous sweetness.
I cannot resist it, I can <i>not</i> resist it. My eyes go towards
those clouds, my soul goes towards those clouds, my dreams go towards
them &hellip; and I love him, I love him&#8202;&hellip;. I feel
ashamed: sometimes I dare not look my son in the face&#8202;&hellip;. I
love him, I love him; and I feel ashamed: sometimes I dare not go
across the street, as though people would notice it, by the light on my
face&#8202;&hellip;. But ah, no, that light does not shine from me,
because I am old! It does from Marianne, poor child, but not from me
&hellip; oh, thank God for that!&hellip; I want to struggle against it,
but it is stronger than I; and, when I think of him, I feel as if I
were numbed here in my chair. When he comes into the room, I tremble,
powerless to make a movement. Let me be ashamed of myself, argue with
myself, struggle as I may, it is so, it is something real, as though I
had never felt anything real in my life: it is a dream and it is also
reality&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb220"
href="#pb220" name="pb220">220</a>]</span></p>
<p>She often strove against it, but the dream was always too strong for
her, enveloping her as with a multitude of languorous spring scents. It
imparted a strange tenderness to her, to her fresh, round face, the
face of a woman in her prime, with the strange, soft, curly hair, which
the years were changing without turning grey. If he came, she awoke
from that dream, but felt herself blissfully languid and faint.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not a girl,&rdquo; she thought, now that she heard
herself speak; but her fixed idea, that she was old, quite old,
retreated a little way into the background.</p>
<p>But, though she now no longer felt so old in her dream, after her
dream she thought herself ignorant. Oh, how ignorant she was! And why
had she never acquired an atom of knowledge in her wasted days, in her
squandered, empty years. When she was talking to Brauws&mdash;and now
that he came regularly, they often talked together, long and earnestly,
in the friendly twilight&mdash;she thought:</p>
<p>&ldquo;How ignorant I am!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had to make an effort sometimes to follow him in the simplest
things that he said. She was obliged to confess to him that she had
never learnt very much. But he said that that was a good thing, that it
had kept her mind fresh. She shook her head in disclaimer; she
confessed that she was ignorant and stupid. He protested; but she told
him <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb221" href="#pb221" name=
"pb221">221</a>]</span>frankly that it sometimes tired her to follow
him. And she was so honest with him that she herself was sometimes
surprised at it. If ever their conversation became too hopelessly deep,
she preferred to be silent rather than lie or even seek an evasion in
words&#8202;&hellip;. Ignorant, yes; and it distressed her to such an
extent that, one afternoon, when Henri was out and Addie at school, she
went to her son&rsquo;s room and opened his book-case. In addition to
the ordinary school-manuals, it contained a few boys&rsquo;-books; and
she laughed at herself, her little tender, mocking laugh of gentle
irony. But she found a couple of volumes on Universal History, a
present from Van der Welcke to Addie, who was very fond of history; and
she opened them where she stood. She turned the pages. She was afraid
that some one might come in: the maid, perhaps, by accident. She sat
down in the only easy-chair, impregnated with the smoke of the
cigarettes which Van der Welcke smoked one after the other, silently,
while Addie was preparing his lessons; and she turned the pages and
read. She continued to suffer from that sense of her own absurdity. She
felt like a schoolgirl dreaming &hellip; and learning her lessons. She
went on reading; and, when Truitje was looking for her all over the
house and she heard her ask the cook where on earth mevrouw could be,
she blushed violently, quickly put the books back on the shelves and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb222" href="#pb222" name=
"pb222">222</a>]</span>left the room. She would have liked to take the
books with her, but dared not; however, that evening at dinner she
plucked up courage and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Addie, Mr. Brauws was saying something about the French
Revolution the other day; and I felt so stupid at being so ignorant on
the subject. Have you any books about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes, he had this book and that book, in fact he had always been
attracted by that period and had collected as many books upon it as his
scanty pocket-money permitted. He would bring them to her after dinner.
And she acquired a sort of passion for reading and learning. She
indulged it almost hastily, feverishly, without any method, as though
nervously anxious to make up for the deficiencies of her own education.
And at the same time she was frightened lest other people&mdash;even
Van der Welcke and Addie&mdash;should notice that fevered haste; and
she devoured book after book with studied cunning, sometimes turning
the pages over hurriedly, feverishly, then again reading more
attentively, but never leaving the books about, always replacing them
on her boy&rsquo;s shelves, or returning them to Brauws and Paul when
they had been borrowed from them, or carefully putting away those which
she had bought herself, so that her room apparently remained the same,
without the confusion and untidiness of a lot of books. Her reading was
a strange medley: a volume of Quack&rsquo;s <i>Socialists</i>, which
Brauws lent her; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb223" href="#pb223"
name="pb223">223</a>]</span>Zola&rsquo;s novel,
<i>L&rsquo;&OElig;uvre</i>; a pamphlet by Bakunin and an odd number of
the <i>Gids</i>; a copy of <i>The Imitation</i> which had strayed among
Van der Welcke&rsquo;s books; Gonse on Japanese Art; Tolstoi&rsquo;s
novels and pamphlets. But it was a strange bold power of discrimination
that at once taught her to pick and choose amid the chaos of all this
literature, made her accept this and reject that: a psychological
analysis; a new work on modern social evolution; an &aelig;sthetic
rhapsody about a Japanese vase. She learnt quickly to look into them
boldly and to take from them what was able as it were to develop her;
and out of many of those books there flashed forth such entirely new
revelations of hitherto unperceived truths that often, tired, dazed,
astounded, she asked herself:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there so much then? Is so much thought about, dreamt
about, so much sought for, lived for? Do people have those visions
then, those dreams? And does it all exist? And can it all be taken in
by me, by my intelligence?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And, as she thought, it seemed as if crape veils were being raised
everywhere from before her and as if she, whose gaze had never wandered
from her family and friends, now saw, suddenly, through the distant
clouds, right into those cities, right into those civilizations, into
the future, into the past, into so much of the present as still hovered
closely around her own existence. She experienced shock after shock:
she felt dimly that even the terrible French <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb224" href="#pb224" name=
"pb224">224</a>]</span>Revolution, though it did cost Marie-Antoinette
her life, had its good side. Zola seemed to her so magnificent that she
was almost frightened at her own enthusiasm and dared not put her
feeling into words. And the noble dreams of those apostles of humanity,
even though they anathematized the power of the State and
money&mdash;all that she had unconsciously looked upon, all her life,
as indispensable to civilized society&mdash;made her quiver first with
alarm, then with compassion, then with terror, with despair, with
exultation&#8202;&hellip;. She did not utter her thoughts; only, in her
conversations with Brauws, she felt that she was gradually better able
to follow him, that she was more responsive, less vague in her
replies&#8202;&hellip;. If in all this, this new self-education, there
was something hurried and superficial, the tremulous haste of an eager,
nervous woman who fears that she is devoting herself too late to what
is vitally necessary, there was at the same time something fresh and
ingenuous, something youthful and unspoilt, like the enthusiasm of a
woman still young who, after her girlish dreams, wants to grasp some
part of the vivid, many-coloured, radiant life around her, who grasps
with joyous open hands at the colours and the sunbeams and who, though
she grasps wildly, nevertheless gathers fresh life in her
illusion&#8202;&hellip;. She gathered fresh life. The wind that blew
outside seemed to blow through her soul; the rain that pelted seemed
actually to wash her face; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb225" href=
"#pb225" name="pb225">225</a>]</span>the continual gusts on every hand
blew the mist from before her eyes, drew it aside like a
curtain&#8202;&hellip;. Her eyes sparkled; and, when the winter had
done blowing and raining, when suddenly, without any transition, a
breath of spring&mdash;the limpid blue of the sky, the tender green of
the stirring earth&mdash;floated over and through the Woods, it was as
though she yearned for movement. She managed, every afternoon that
Addie was free, to take him away from Van der Welcke and to lure him
out for a long walk, out of the town, over the dunes, ever so far.
Addie, with his eyes bright with laughing surprise, thought it very
jolly of her and would go with her, though he was no walker and
preferred bicycling, athirst for speed. But, in his young, gallant
boy&rsquo;s soul, he laughed softly, thought Mamma charming: grown
years younger, grown into a young woman, suddenly, in her short skirt,
her little cloth cape, with the sailor-hat on her curly hair and the
colour in her cheeks, slim-waisted, quick-footed, her voice clear, her
laugh sometimes ringing out suddenly. He thought of Papa and that she
was now becoming as young as he; and Addie felt himself old beside her.
He saw nothing of what was happening in his mother, even as nobody saw
it, for she kept it to herself, was no different to the others, spoke
no differently to the others, perhaps only just with a brighter laugh.
What she read, what she learnt, what she felt, what she thought: all
this was not perceptible <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb226" href=
"#pb226" name="pb226">226</a>]</span>to the others. It did not shine
out from her; and her foot merely moved a shade quicker, her speech
became a shade more spontaneous. But everything that blossomed and
flamed up in her she kept to herself, in the vast silence of her broad
but unshared vistas. To her husband she was gentler, to her son she was
younger. Only now, in those walks, perhaps Addie was the one person in
her life who noticed that, when Mamma happened to mention Mr.
Brauws&rsquo; name, an unusual note sounded in her brighter, younger
voice. A boy of his age does not analyse a subtle perception of this
kind; only, without reasoning, without analysing, just instinctively,
this boy of fourteen thought of his father, whom he worshipped with a
strange, protecting adoration such as one gives to a brother or a
friend&mdash;a younger brother, a younger friend&mdash;and felt a pang
of jealousy on his behalf, jealousy of this man who did what Papa never
did, talked with Mamma for hours three or four times a week, so often
in fact that she was growing younger, that she had taken to reading, so
as no longer to be ignorant, that she had developed a need for walking
great distances. But the lad kept this jealousy locked up within
himself, allowed none to perceive it. Perhaps he was just a trifle
colder to him, to this man, the friend of the family, though Brauws was
so fond of him, Addie, almost passionately fond of him indeed: Addie
knew that. This jealousy for his father, jealousy of that <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb227" href="#pb227" name=
"pb227">227</a>]</span>friend of the family, was very strong in him;
and he felt himself to be the child of both his parents, felt within
himself their double heritage of jealousy. The image of his father
appeared constantly before him, appeared between the images of Brauws
and of his mother. But he let her see nothing of it.</p>
<p>She gathered fresh life in those walks. When Addie was at school,
she walked alone, no longer fearing the loneliness out of doors, she
who had come to love her indoor loneliness and the still deeper
loneliness of her soul. It was as though, after dreaming and educating
herself&mdash;quickly, nervously, superficially and with youthful
simplicity&mdash;in what great men had thought and written, she felt
herself breathe again in the midst of nature. No longer from her
arm-chair, through the windows, along the bend of the curtains did she
see the great clouds, but she now saw them out of doors and overhead,
blue, white, immense, irradiated by the sun in the vault of the
boundless spring skies all vocal with birds, saw them as she stood on
the dunes, with the wind all round her head, all round her hair and
blowing through her skirts&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I love him, I love him,&rdquo; a voice inside her sang softly
and yet insistently, while the wind&rsquo;s strong passion seemed to
lift her up and waft her along.</p>
<p>But in the movement of her hands there was something as though she
were resisting the wind, with a smile of gentle irony, of tender
mockery. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb228" href="#pb228" name=
"pb228">228</a>]</span>The wind blew past, as if grumbling, and she
walked on, saw the sea. She seemed to look upon the sea for the first
time. It was as though, in the strong wind, under the blue-white
clouds, the sea streamed to her for the first time from the ethereal
fount of the horizon and were now rushing towards her, roaring and
frothing, like a triumph of multitudinous, white-crested horses. And
the sky and the sea were as one great triumph of mighty, omnipotent
nature. A nameless but overwhelming triumph seemed from out of those
clouds to hold reins in thousands of fists, the reins of the
multitudinous white-crested horses; and all that triumph of nature
advanced towards her like a riot of youth. It was as though every atom
of her former life, every memory flew away around her like sand, like
dust, like straw. It all flew away; and the waves broke, the sea
uplifted itself like an exulting menace, as though to carry her with it
in the riotous rush of its triumphant crested steeds, over all that
small life, over everything &hellip; if she did not take care.</p>
<p>It was all big, wide, far-reaching, like a world. When she reached
home, she was tired out, sobered by the tram-ride and the last bit of
walking, past casual, shadowy people. Worn out, she fell asleep, woke
shortly before dinner, welcomed Addie in a dream. Until sometimes she
read her son&rsquo;s eyes, made an effort, plunged her face in a basin
of water, tried to be, to appear as she had always been. And
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb229" href="#pb229" name=
"pb229">229</a>]</span>then, in the glass, she saw herself like that,
to all appearance the same woman, with just something livelier in her
eyes, her gait, her movements. But inside her everything was
changed.</p>
<p>At home sometimes the past would still rise up before her, but
different, quite different. She seemed to withdraw from her former
personality and it was as though, far removed from the woman that she
had once been, she was now for the first time able to judge her past
from another point of view than her own. She saw suddenly what her
father must have suffered, Mamma, the brothers even, the sisters. She
realized for the first time the sacrifice which those old, pious
people, Henri&rsquo;s parents, had made. She thought in dismay of the
injury which she had done her first husband, De Staffelaer. She thought
of them all, in dismay at herself, in compassion for them. And she felt
sorry even for her husband and for what he had always querulously
resented, his shattered career, which had constituted his grudge, his
obsession, the excuse for his inertia: for Van der Welcke and even for
that grudge she felt compassion. How young he was when she met him,
when they had acted their comedy, their comedy which had become deadly
earnest! And she had at once fettered him to herself, in
ever-increasing antagonism! Then her eyes would rest on him with a more
understanding glance, sometimes almost with a certain pity, as she
looked into his eyes, his young <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb230"
href="#pb230" name="pb230">230</a>]</span>blue boyish eyes, which Addie
had inherited from him, but which in the father looked younger, more
boyish than in the son. If, at the sound of his voice, the inclination
to speak to him irritably welled up in her from the eternal antagonism
between them, as from a gloomy spring deep down in her, she would
restrain herself, control herself with that new sympathy and pity,
answer gently, almost jokingly, and would let him have the last word.
And, now that she herself was in love and felt herself live again, she
had a sympathy that was almost motherly for his love, even though she
herself was beginning to feel young again, and with it a strange
tenderness for the two of them, Marianne and Henri. She did not think
of the danger for him; she still had only, in her new world of romance,
a sympathy for romance. He was her husband, but she felt none of a
wife&rsquo;s jealousy. And for Marianne she felt the same strange
compassion, as for a younger sister-in-love&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>There came to her scarcely a fleeting thought of the immorality
which the world, people, small people&mdash;the whirlers in the little
circle, with their little prejudices and dogmas, their little creeds
and philosophies&mdash;would see in such strange views from a married
woman concerning herself and a friend, concerning her husband and the
little niece with whom her husband was evidently in love. She was a
small creature like all of them, she was a small soul, like
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb231" href="#pb231" name=
"pb231">231</a>]</span>all of them; but her soul at least was growing,
growing upwards and outwards; she no longer felt depressed; and it
seemed as if she were being borne on wings to the greater cloud-worlds
yonder, to the far cities, where flashed the lightnings of the new
revelations, the new realities&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>Everything in her was changed&#8202;&hellip;. <span class=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Max Brauws was a thinker as well as a man of action;
and each of these two personalities insisted on having its period of
domination. After his college days, he had wandered over Europe for
years, vaguely seeking an object in life. Deep down in himself,
notwithstanding all his restless activity, he remained a dreamer, as he
had been in his childhood and boyhood. It seemed as if that which he
had sought in his dreams when playing as a boy on the fir-clad hills
and over the moors went on beckoning him, darkly and elusively, a
mystic, nebulous veil on the dim horizons of the past; and, when he ran
towards them, those far horizons, they receded more and more into the
distance, fading little by little; and the veil was like a little
cloud, melting into thin air&#8202;&hellip;. He had wandered about for
years, his soul oppressed by a load of knowledge, by the load of
knowing all that men had thought, planned, believed, dreamed,
worshipped, achieved. An almost mechanically accurate memory had
arranged those loads in his brain in absolute order; and, if he had not
been above all things driven by the unrest of his imagination, with its
eternal dreaming and its eternal yearning to find what it sought, he
would have become a quiet scholar, living in the country, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb233" href="#pb233" name="pb233">233</a>]</span>far
from cities, with a great library around him; for very often, when
spent with weariness, he had a vision of an ideal repose. But the
unrest and the yearning had always driven him on, driven him through
the world; and they had both made him seek, for himself as well as for
others, because, if he had found for others, he would also have found
for himself. They, the unrest and the yearning, had driven him on
towards the great centres of life, towards the black gloom of the
English and German manufacturing-towns, towards the unhappy moujiks in
Russia, towards the famine-stricken villages of Sicily, all in a
heart-rending passion to know, to have seen, penetrated and experienced
all the misery of the world. And the capitals had risen up around him
like gigantic Babels of fevered pride, accumulations of egotisms; the
smoke of the manufacturing-towns had smeared along the horizon of his
life the soot-black clouds through which he could not see and in which
the days remained eternally defiled; the Russian snow-landscapes had
spread out as eternal, untraversable steppes&mdash;steppes and steppes
and steppes&mdash;of absolutely colourless despair; in Italy he had
beheld an appalling contrast between the magnificence of the
country&mdash;the glory of its scenery, the melancholy of its
art&mdash;and the sorrows of the afflicted nation, which, as in a haze
of gold, against a background of sublime ruins and shimmering blue,
along rows of palaces full of noble treasures, uttered <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb234" href="#pb234" name="pb234">234</a>]</span>its
cry of hunger, shook its threatening fist, because the old ground
brought forth not another olive, not one, after the excesses of the
past, exhausted by the birth-pangs of the untold glories of
old&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>His mind, schooled in book-lore, also read life itself, learnt to
know it, fathomed it with a glance. He saw the world, saw its
wickedness, its selfishness, saw especially its awful, monstrous
hypocrisy. Like so many leering, grinning masks, with treacherous
honeyed smiles, contradicting the furtive glances of the diabolical
eyes, he saw the powers of the world above the world itself: a huge
nightmare of compact distress, the greedy, covetous, grasping fingers
hidden as though ready to clutch at the folds of the majestic purple,
ready to strike like vultures&rsquo; claws. And he saw&mdash;O terrible
vision!&mdash;the world as a helpless, quivering mass lying for
centuries under that eternal menace. He saw it everywhere. Then he
wanted to free himself with a gigantic effort from the sphinx-like
domination of his impotence, with its eternally unseeing eyes, its
eternally silent lips, its undivining mind; and his movement was as
that of one who lies crushed under granite, the granite of that
omnipotent sphinx of impotence, who, with her eternal immovability,
seemed to be saying nothing but this:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am unchangeable, eternally; against me everything is
eternally dashing itself to pieces; against me your dreams scatter into
mist. I alone am, but I am <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb235" href=
"#pb235" name="pb235">235</a>]</span>that which is unchangeable: human
impotence, your own impotence. Lie still at my feet, do not move: I
alone am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was the vision of his hopeless eyes. But desperation drove him
on, wandering ever on and on to other lands, to other capitals, to
other towns black with smoke: the smoke through which nothing shone,
not a single gleam of hope. And for years it was the same: wandering,
seeking, not finding; only seeing, knowing, realizing. But the more he
saw, knew and realized, the more terrible it was to him that he could
not find the very first word of the solution, the more terrible it
became to him that only the sphinx remained, the immovable granite
impotence; and her blank gaze seemed to utter her solitary
revelation:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I alone am. I am impotence; but I am immovable, I am
omnipotent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he had felt in himself the need to do still more, to be really
a doer, a common workman, as they all were, everywhere, the poor and
wretched. And he went to America, in order no longer to think, read,
ponder, dream, see or know, but to do what they were all doing, the
poor and wretched. And it was as he had succeeded in telling Constance
at last, after so many hesitations: everything that was atavistic in
him had prevented him from becoming a brother, a fellow-worker. But he
was scarcely back in Europe before he felt the air around him
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb236" href="#pb236" name=
"pb236">236</a>]</span>full of noble aims, passionate hopes; and Peace
had shone before his eyes. He spoke; and his words were as the words of
one inspired; and everybody went to hear him. He had spoken in Holland;
he now went to Germany and spoke there. He wrote his book there:
<i>Peace</i>. He went on doing and moving, until he was laid low not
only with the fatigue of thinking and meditating, but also with the
strain of constantly travelling hither and thither, of constantly
appearing in overcrowded halls, of speaking in a clear, resonant voice
to thousands of people. For a moment he said to himself that he was
doing something, something even greater and better than his manual
labour in America had been. For a moment he said to himself that he had
found, if not everything, at least something, an atom of absolute good,
and that he was imparting that atom to the world. But dull
discouragement came and smote him, as well as physical strain, and left
him saying to himself:</p>
<p>&ldquo;They cheer and applaud, but nothing is changed. Everything
remains as it is, as if I had never spoken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His impatience demanded an immediate realization and the sight of
the ideal flashing across the horizon. And then he lost all hope even
for the future, for the brighter ages that were dawning. A mocking
laugh, a sarcastic word in a report on his lectures was enough to
shatter him for weeks. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb237" href=
"#pb237" name="pb237">237</a>]</span>He hid himself like a leper, or
allowed himself to be luxuriously lapped in the leafy melancholy of the
German mountain-forests, or went, farther and higher, into the Alps,
made reckless ascents, just himself and a guide, as though, along the
pure world of the slippery glaciers, he hoped to find what he had
sought in vain in the Old World and the New, in the world of all and of
himself.</p>
<p>Then he remained for weeks lingering on in a lonely little village
in Switzerland, high up among the eternal snows, as though he wished to
purify himself of all the dust of his humanity. Merely through
breathing the exquisite rareness of the air, especially at night, when
in the higher heavens the stars shone nearer to him, twinkling out
their living rays, it seemed as if the pure cold were cleansing him to
his marrow, to his soul. He gazed back almost peacefully upon his life
as a man of thought and action, thought and action being two things in
which a man is able to indulge only if he be willing to live, for
others and for himself. If anything of his thought, of his action
remained drifting in those lower atmospheres of the suffering world, he
was certain that this would be so little, so infinitesimally small,
that he himself did not perceive it, like an atom of dust floating in
the immensity of the future. Perhaps then the atom would prove to be a
little grain and, as such, be built into the substance of the ideal.
But, even if this were so, his thought and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb238" href="#pb238" name="pb238">238</a>]</span>his
action and their possible results seemed to him so small, so slight
that he was filled with humility. And in this humility there was a
pride in being humble; for did he not remember all the complacency, the
dogmatism, the conviction, the assurance, the self-consciousness, all
the pedantry that battened down there?</p>
<p>Amid the serenity of the mountains, as he sent his gaze roaming over
the frost-bound horizons, all within him became pure and crystal-clear,
his soul a very prism. He saw its colours lying there plainly, shining,
glittering, with none of the foulness of that lower world. And these
weeks were weeks of the deepest and most health-giving rest that he had
ever known.</p>
<p>He now felt very lonely. He was not the man to give himself up to
the simple enjoyment of this healing rest. He loved best to feel the
multitude around him, to fling out his strong arms wide towards
humanity, feeling his most ardent and happiest glow when embracing
humanity. But, after his discouragements, he seemed to have thrust it
gently, though kindly, a little farther from him, had abandoned it, had
sequestered himself, in order to recover from himself and from humanity
in the ample, restful silence of utter solitude. He now felt very
lonely. And a longing awoke in him, stirring but feebly as yet, for
love to come towards him now, because hitherto love had always gone out
from him, eager <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb239" href="#pb239"
name="pb239">239</a>]</span>and passionate; a longing to be sought
himself, for once in his life; to see arms opened to him this time,
waiting to embrace him, to press him to a loving heart&#8202;&hellip;.
A feeling of melancholy softened him, made him small and human, while
the mountain-wind swept past on giant wings&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>He looked back upon his life. That was one thing which it had never
known: that concentration of all feeling on an individual. With him,
any whole-hearted feeling had always been for the many. When he looked
back, he saw spectres wandering through the past: the individual, the
unit, just a faint blur here and there; he had never felt that
all-devouring passion for them, the individuals. And yet, as a child,
as a boy, playing his dream-game amid woods, fields, heather and
stream, for whom had his longing been? To find all of them, humanity,
or the one individual soul? He did not know; but a dreamer he had
always remained, for all his thinking and doing. And now, after the
many had brought him sorrow, he began to dream, for the first time, of
the one&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>Of the one &hellip; the one individual soul that would open wide
arms to him and approach him with a loving embrace &hellip; one
individual soul&#8202;&hellip;. Had his quest always been the
self-deception of impotence and was it possible that now that quest had
become a search for the one individual soul? Suddenly, through his
longing, he remembered an evening: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb240"
href="#pb240" name="pb240">240</a>]</span>a table with flowers and
candles; men talking amid the smoke of their cigars; the burly figure
of a fair-haired officer; and some strange words which that officer had
just uttered as though unconsciously, in the course of ordinary
conversation: a vision calling up early years of childhood, childish
play, a little girl, fair, with red flowers at her temples, dressed in
white, running barefoot over great boulders in a river full of rocks,
under the heavy foliage of the tropical trees, and beckoning, beckoning
with her little hand to the two elder brothers who were playing with
her, fascinated by their little sister&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>There, in that room, through the smoke of the cigars, amid the hum
of indifferent talk, in three or four sentences, no more, that big,
fair-haired man had said it, said it just casually, with a softening of
his rough, noisy voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was wonderful, the way she had of playing. She would run
over the rocks and pluck the flowers. Lord, how adorable she looked,
the little witch! And we boys used to run with her, run after her, as
far as ever she pleased. She only had to beckon to us &hellip; the
damned, adorable little witch!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the oath sounded like a caress; and the whole thing was only a
picture lasting two or three seconds, no more; and then they returned
to the smell of coffee and liqueurs, the cigar-smoke, the noisy voice
growing rough again, becoming coarse and jovial as the burly,
fair-haired soldier told some mess-room tale <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb241" href="#pb241" name=
"pb241">241</a>]</span>immediately afterwards, after that reminiscence.
But in him, Brauws, the reminiscence had lingered, as though always
visible: the picture shining in the tenderness with which the brother
had spoken of his sister; and it seemed to him as though he himself had
seen, but more vaguely and dimly, once in his life, on those Dutch
horizons of his childhood, a blur like that of the little figure, the
bright, fair-faced child, even the little red note of her
flowers&#8202;&hellip;. Oh, how vague it was, how visionary! You
thought of it &hellip; and it had gone, all of it, leaving hardly the
memory of a perfume, nay, hardly the reflection of a memory! Really, it
was nothing, nothing, too airy for thought and impossible to describe
in words, however tenderly chosen. It was nothing: if he thought about
it for more than the one second that the reflection flashed across him,
it was gone, quite lost&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>He was feeling very lonely now&#8202;&hellip;. Oh, to think of the
passing years with their millions of meetings, so many men and women
just brushing against one another, in that casual passing, just looking
into one another&rsquo;s eyes, with the indifferent look of
non-recognition, and then passing one another again, never seeing one
another after!&hellip; And perhaps among them the one had passed, her
eyes looking indifferently into his eyes, a bit of her body or dress
brushing against his body or dress &hellip; and she was gone, gone,
lost altogether forever. Was that how it had happened in his life? Or
not? Was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb242" href="#pb242" name=
"pb242">242</a>]</span>life sometimes merciful at the eleventh hour,
giving the one, the individual soul, as a consolation, as a reward for
that love for the many?</p>
<p>Now he felt quite lonely, he who was a dreamer as well as a thinker
and a man of action. And an irresistible wish to be no longer lonely
made him come down suddenly from that ring of glittering peaks. There
was nothing waiting for him in Holland, nothing to draw him towards
those low lands of his birth, into the swarm of utterly indifferent
people, full of petty insignificance, save alone, perhaps, that it was
there&mdash;in the same house where the vision had been conjured
up&mdash;there that the soul was waiting, there that the one individual
soul would bide his coming.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is only a fancy,&rdquo; he now thought. &ldquo;A fancy
&hellip; at my age! No, if any such thing had to happen, it would have
happened in the years of youth in which we have the right to feel, to
dream, to seek &hellip; to seek for the one. Now that so many years,
silent, dead years, lie heaped up around her and around me &hellip; and
between us, now it becomes absurd to feel, to dream, to seek those
sweet solaces which we feel, dream and seek only when we are very
young, but not when we have lost even our right to the remembrance of
our youth, the reflection of our childish
memories&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still he came down from the mountains&#8202;&hellip;. <span class=

<h2 class="main">Chapter XXIV</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It was not until he was standing in front of her, at
the Hague, that he knew, in his innermost soul, that he had come back
to Holland because of her and of her alone. It struck him at once that
her eyes were brighter, her movements younger, that her voice sounded
clearer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have read your book!&rdquo; was the first thing that she
said to him, radiantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he asked, while his deep, almost sombre eyes
laughed in his rough, bronzed face.</p>
<p>She would not tell him that the book, <i>Peace</i>, written in his
clear, luminous style, prophesying in ringing tones the great watchword
of the future, had consoled her for his three months&rsquo; absence.
She managed to speak of it in terms of quiet appreciation, betraying no
sign of her enthusiasm except by an added brightness in her eyes and a
curious lilt in her voice, with its echo of summer and of carolling
birds. The book was a great success, written as it were in one breath,
as though he had uttered it in a single sentence of quiet knowledge,
warning them of the coming changes in the world; in a single sentence
of quiet consolation, foretelling its future destinies. There was in
his words, in that one long sentence of prophetic consolation, an
irresistible <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb244" href="#pb244" name=
"pb244">244</a>]</span>sweetness, a magic charm which affected for a
moment even the most sceptical of his readers, even though they scoffed
at it immediately afterwards; something wonderful, inspired &hellip;
and so simple that the word was spoken almost without art, only with a
note that sounded strangely clear, as though echoing from some higher
plane. He had thought out the book during his lecturing-period in
Holland and Germany; he had written it up there, high up in the Alps,
with his eyes roaming over the ice-bound horizons; and it had often
seemed to him as if Peace were waving her argent banners in the pure
air, her joyous processions descending from the eternal snows of the
upper air to the pollution of the lower, to trumpet forth with blithe
clarions the holy tidings, the fair, unfaltering
prophecy&#8202;&hellip;. The book had comforted her; she had read it in
the Woods, on the dunes, by the sea; and, in the warm summer air, with
its tang of salt, she had sat with the book in her hands and felt him
with her, though absent&#8202;&hellip;. She knew the sentences by
heart; but she tempered her enthusiasm, lest she should betray herself.
And, when she had spoken of the book and was silent for a moment, he
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now tell me about yourself! What have you been doing all
these months?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have I been doing?&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. You must have done something besides reading my
<i>Peace</i>!&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb245" href="#pb245"
name="pb245">245</a>]</span></p>
<p>She almost blushed; and a thrill went through her, that catch at her
throat and grip at her heart which his step, his voice, his glance
could still always give her; and she was not able to answer at once.
Yes, really she had done nothing that summer except read his
<i>Peace</i>! So it seemed to her for a moment. But, when she recovered
from that sudden wave of emotion, she reflected that it was not so;
that she had read other things; that she had dreamt, had thought; that
she had lived! It was very strange, but she reflected &hellip; that she
had lived!</p>
<p>It was as though both of them had much to say to each other and yet
did not know how to say it. Van der Welcke was not at home; and they
talked together for a long time of indifferent things. He felt all the
while that a vague question was rising to his lips, a question hardly
formulated even in his mind. He longed to ask her something, such a
question as a brother&rsquo;s tenderness might have prompted, to which
she would answer with a sister&rsquo;s ready sympathy. But he did not
know how to speak; and so he buried within himself that strange bright
tenderness which longed to give itself expression, to ask its
questions; and he locked himself up in his deep, mournful seriousness,
the sombreness of a middle-aged man. She also, opposite him, was the
same, sat and spoke like a middle-aged woman; he remarked the soft grey
of her curling hair; and both of them, serious, almost indifferent,
talked <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb246" href="#pb246" name=
"pb246">246</a>]</span>quietly, if sympathetically, of casual
things&#8202;&hellip;. And yet he felt that, deep down in herself, she
was changed. She had never looked like that before, never spoken so
clearly, with such young and lively gestures. He noticed that she had
been reading, that she had read other books than his <i>Peace</i>; and,
when he told her of the world of misery which he had seen quite lately
in Germany, she replied in a tone of compassion which struck him,
because it was no more the shuddering pity of a woman of the world for
the misery that swarms far beneath her like vermin, but true
compassion, the welling up of a new and generous youth in her soul, an
enthusiasm now experienced for the very first time. How sincerely her
answer rang, how fervent were the words in which she uttered it! He was
astonished and told her so, told her that he would never have suspected
such sincerity, such fervour, such capacity for pity in a woman of her
caste. But she defended her caste, especially because she did not wish
to be too exuberant in her new youth and new life and was perpetually
suppressing herself. And so now, to hide her feelings, she defended her
caste: did he not think that there were others who had the power of
feeling as she did for the misery of the world, women like herself,
women of her caste, not merely those who perform their perfunctory
little works of charity, but other women who welcome the new ideas and
above all the new sentiments of universal <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb247" href="#pb247" name="pb247">247</a>]</span>brotherhood, women
who will perhaps stamp them on their coming children, are already
implanting them, germ by germ, so that later, soon indeed, they will
bear a new generation whose lives will be based on those sentiments of
brotherhood? He was surprised at what she said, but he brushed it aside
with a rough gesture, while a glance of hatred flashed from his sombre,
brooding eyes, deep-set in his rough face&mdash;a glance that was
sometimes anguished as though with pain&mdash;and he said to her that
this was not true, that it could not be, that her whole caste was
nothing but egoism, nothing but hypocrisy, vast and monstrous, its
hypocrisy perhaps even more colossal than its egoism, and that he was
surprised at himself for having any friendly feeling towards her, a
woman of her caste. A rough candour made his voice sound harsh. But she
was not offended by it; she listened to him although out of his rough
words there came a gust which seemed likely to overthrow all that she
had long looked upon as cultured, correct, respectable, irreproachable,
moral and aristocratic. It was as though her reading, like a breeze
from the sea or the dunes, had suddenly removed and blown away from her
all the pettiness, the miserable distortion of the dwarf plant with its
aping of greatness; all the everlasting strife of opinions, interests
and prejudices waged in and around all those creatures of the world,
the women of her set. He noticed it, with a thrill of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb248" href="#pb248" name=
"pb248">248</a>]</span>happiness; and he knew that they understood each
other. There had sprung up between them the common understanding, the
common discussion of things that are never discussed in current
conversation.</p>
<p>And, because of his happiness, he knew that he loved her, even
though it was late in the day, even though it was too late. He had
never known a love like that; he felt it now for the first, the very
first time, that wave of exultant, smiling happiness, but at the same
time he felt it like a shadow, a grief, a regret for what might have
been. She had not yet felt it like that, a regret for what might have
been, because she was living again, because she was living for the
first time, late but not too late, since she was living at last in a
real, intense, pulsating life; but to him, the man who had lived but
only never loved, it came at once, came as regret for what might have
been&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>And his love seemed never likely to become anything else than just
that: regret&#8202;&hellip;. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb249" href=

<h2 class="main">Chapter XXV</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In these days, when Constance felt herself becoming so
strangely young and alive&mdash;she who for so long believed that she
had never, never lived&mdash;she was compelled to step outside that
life dominated purely by feeling. Van Vreeswijck came to her one
evening and sat talking for hours. She liked him; she valued him as a
good friend who, notwithstanding that he really belonged to the most
insufferable section of the Court set, had shown that he was not too
much afraid of degrading himself by associating with Van der Welcke,
with her or even with Brauws, though he loudly and sweepingly condemned
Brauws&rsquo; views. She, in her new pride of life, looked down upon
him, with a kindly contempt, as one of the little people in the narrow
little circle, a humming-top spinning around itself and around other
humming-tops, just another figure in the merry-go-round which they
represented to her, all of them; but she valued his unaffected
friendship and, though she thought him anything but a great soul, she
did not think him a base or evil soul. And so she spoke to him
sympathetically that evening and promised to help him.</p>
<p>She promised; and yet it was exceedingly difficult. A new honesty
had sprung up in her, making her hesitate to whom to turn first. She
had meant to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb250" href="#pb250" name=
"pb250">250</a>]</span>speak to Van der Welcke the next morning, in
quite an ordinary way. But, when she saw him for a moment before he
went out, he seemed to her to be suppressing some secret grief deep
down in himself: his blue boyish eyes were overcast, his mouth
half-sulking, as on rainy days when he was not able to go cycling; and
yet it was fine now, a fine autumn day, and he came down in his
cycling-suit, fetched his bicycle, said that he was going a long way,
that he would perhaps not be back for lunch. She suspected in him a
craving to get away, as fast as possible and as far as possible, and to
deaden with that wild speed the pain of his gnawing grief. But, in the
soft glow of her new youth, which illuminated everything within her and
around her, she had not the heart to tell him what she was going to do,
what she had promised to do, though in her secret self she thought it
dishonest not to tell him straight out. So she said nothing, let him
go. She looked after him for a moment, watched the angry curve of his
shoulders, as he pedalled desperately, in his mad craving to get away,
far away.</p>
<p>She sighed, felt sorry for him, she no longer knew why or wherefore
&hellip; But she had promised Van Vreeswijck; and perhaps, she thought,
it would be best so. She went out therefore, took the tram to the
Bezuidenhout, rang at Bertha&rsquo;s door, found her at home. In the
hall, the removers&rsquo; men were busy packing china and glass in big
cases. Louise and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb251" href="#pb251"
name="pb251">251</a>]</span>Frans were going from room to room with a
list in their hands, making notes of the furniture which Mamma would
want at Baarn. The little villa had been taken.</p>
<p>Constance found Bertha upstairs in Van Naghel&rsquo;s study. She was
sitting at an open window in the large room with its dark, heavy
furniture, gazing into the garden, with her hands in her lap. She
seemed calmer than she had been the other evening, at Mamma&rsquo;s.
She sat there in her black dress, her face old and drawn, but calmer
now; and her eyes never left the garden, a town garden full of
rose-trees and fragrant in the late summer air. But all around her the
room was gloomy and deadly and desolate. The book-cases were empty: the
books had been taken out and divided among the boys. Only the large
bronze inkstand remained on the writing-table. The furniture stood
stiff, formal, stripped, unused, lifeless, as though awaiting the day
of the sale. The bare walls showed the marks of the etchings and
family-portraits that had been taken down.</p>
<p>Bertha rose when Constance entered; she kissed her and sat down
again at once, sinking into her chair and folding her hands in her lap.
And Constance asked if she could have a moment&rsquo;s serious
conversation with her. A shade of weariness passed over Bertha&rsquo;s
face, as if to convey that she had had so many serious conversations
lately and would rather <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb252" href=
"#pb252" name="pb252">252</a>]</span>go on gazing into the garden. She
lifted her eyes almost sorrowfully from the riot of roses, turned them
on Constance, asked what it was about. And Constance began to tell her:
Van Vreeswijck had been with her for a long time the evening before and
had told her that he had loved Marianne for so long, so
long&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>Bertha was interested for a moment, seemed to wake from a dream:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Van Vreeswijck?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>Constance went on. He had never said a word to Marianne, because he
feared, was almost certain, indeed, that she did not care for him. Had
it not been mentioned that they were moving to Baarn, he would perhaps
not have ventured to speak even now. But this threatened change had
suddenly compelled him to open his heart &hellip; to her, to Constance.
And he had begged Constance to ask Bertha, to ask Marianne herself if
he might hope &hellip; perhaps later&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Van Vreeswijck?&rdquo; Bertha repeated.</p>
<p>Two months ago, though she had never been a match-making mother, she
would have welcomed this proposal, would have rejoiced at it: Van
Vreeswijck was a man of good family, belonged to their own circle and
to the Court set, had a little money; not very young, perhaps, but a
good-looking, pleasant, well-bred fellow. But now she did not know,
showed little or no interest after that momentary <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb253" href="#pb253" name=
"pb253">253</a>]</span>flicker and went on dully, with her hands lying
motionless on her black dress:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I have nothing against it, Constance. If Marianne likes
the idea, I do too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her voice sounded as if she were withdrawing herself from
everything, including her children&rsquo;s interests. She sat there,
just blankly staring, leaving everything to them. Louise and Frans went
through the house looking out the furniture for which there would be
room at Baarn. Constance heard their voices on the stairs:</p>
<p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; Louise was saying, &ldquo;we have, in addition to
the furniture in Mamma&rsquo;s bedroom, in Marianne&rsquo;s and mine,
enough for one spare-room; then there&rsquo;s the piano, from the
drawing-room, and the china-cabinet&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t the china-cabinet ever so much too big &hellip;
for those small rooms down there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, perhaps&#8202;&hellip;. Perhaps we had better leave the
china-cabinet&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bertha heard as well as Constance: perhaps Louise and Frans were
speaking loudly in the passage on purpose. Bertha, however, did not
stir: her eyes remained vague, her hands lifeless. It was obviously a
matter of supreme indifference to her whether they took the
china-cabinet with them or not&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>And, as she did not speak at all, Constance was obliged to ask:
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb254" href="#pb254" name=
"pb254">254</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you mind, Bertha, if I just spoke to
Marianne?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Bertha, &ldquo;do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now? Here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Bertha.</p>
<p>Constance rose, opened the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s two more tables &hellip; two sofas,&rdquo;
Frans counted, making notes on his list.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Louise,&rdquo; said Constance, at the door, &ldquo;would you
ask Marianne to come here a moment?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She sat down again by her sister, affectionately, took her hand,
brimming over with pity for the tired woman whom she had always looked
upon as an ever capable, busy woman of the world, now exhausted with
all the thousand cares of her life and smitten by the sudden blow that
had befallen her. And Constance&rsquo; heart beat anxiously in dread of
what was coming: she trembled, felt her eyes become
wet&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>Marianne entered, pale, almost diaphanous; and her black blouse made
her look a frail little figure of mourning, slender and drooping. For
the thing which she could not conceal in her innermost self was no
longer a light shining from her, visible to all: it was now a cloud
around her, still visible, but as a shadow of grief, whereas but lately
it had been a glow of happiness. Constance at once drew her to her,
kissed her, held her to her. And she could not find words. Bertha did
not speak. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb255" href="#pb255" name=
"pb255">255</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Marianne &hellip;&rdquo; Constance began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you angry, Aunt Constance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, darling, why&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you are angry with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Marianne!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you are different. I have seen it for some time;
there&rsquo;s something, I know&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was no longer the joyous, playful, almost mischievous voice in
which she had said this before. It now sounded rather like a cry of
fear, because it, &ldquo;that,&rdquo; seemed so obvious that every one
was bound to see it, that Aunt Constance herself must needs see it
&hellip; and be angry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really, Marianne, I am not angry. But I wanted to speak to
you alone&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, then you <i>are</i> angry!&rdquo; she said, passionately,
almost hiding herself in Constance&rsquo; arms. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be
angry!&rdquo; she said, almost entreatingly. &ldquo;Do tell me that you
will try &hellip; not to be angry with me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She betrayed herself almost entirely, incapable of keeping back that
which had once shone from her and which now nearly threatened to sob
itself from her. Constance could find no words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall soon be going away, Auntie!&rdquo; said Marianne,
her features wrung with grief. &ldquo;And then you will not see me any
more &hellip; and then &hellip; then perhaps you will never have any
reason to be angry with me again&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then, all at once, she gave a sob, an irresistible <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb256" href="#pb256" name="pb256">256</a>]</span>sob,
jarring every nerve with a shock that seemed to leave her rigid. She
shut her eyes, buried her face in Constance&rsquo; shoulder and
remained lying like this, after that one convulsive sob, motionless,
pale, as though she were dying, as though devastated with sorrow.
Bertha, opposite her, stared at her vaguely, with her hands lying
helplessly on her black dress.</p>
<p>And Constance could find no words. Time after time she thought of
mentioning Van Vreeswijck&rsquo;s name, time after time the name died
away on her lips. She gently urged Marianne to control herself,
assuring her that she was not angry, had never been angry. And for a
moment, thinking of herself, she felt afraid.</p>
<p>If love could be now gladness and now mourning, as it had been and
was in this suffering, love-stricken child, should it not be the same
with her&mdash;that gladness and oh, perhaps later, O God, that
mourning!&mdash;with her, the middle-aged woman, who felt herself
growing younger and a new life coursing through her: at first, in the
soft spring flush of a girl&rsquo;s dreams; now in the summer glory of
a woman&rsquo;s&mdash;a young woman&rsquo;s&mdash;love? But there was a
mirror opposite her; and she saw Marianne grief-smitten, shaken with
sobs &hellip; and in herself she saw nothing! She seemed to have the
power to hide her happiness in her secret self: her agony&mdash;O
God!&mdash;she would also hide later in her secret <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb257" href="#pb257" name=
"pb257">257</a>]</span>self. She saw nothing in herself. And she knew
that nobody saw it in her. It remained secretly, mysteriously hidden.
Adolphine, Cateau, the Ruyvenaers, all of them talked about her husband
and Marianne: she knew it; but she also knew that they never talked
about herself and Brauws &hellip; though she had now known him for
months, though he was the friend of the house and came to their house
almost daily. He was a friend of Van der Welcke&rsquo;s, he was a
friend of the house and a very well-known man; and that was all. It was
not visible to anybody, to anybody&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>Oh, was it not strange? That this same feeling, which she bore in
her innermost self, unseen by any, should shine within her as a sun,
while with Marianne it had shone out, for all the world to see, as an
illicit joy &hellip; and was now streaming forth from her, in a
convulsive sob, as an illicit sorrow. What she, the woman, hid within
her the child could not hide within her, as though her soul were too
slight for it, so slight that it had glowed through her soul as through
alabaster and now flowed from it as from alabaster&#8202;&hellip;. Oh,
was it not strange, was it not strange? After all, she did not hide it
intentionally, for she, the middle-aged woman had never, in her new
young life, thought of the people outside &hellip; in connection with
her reviving youth! But it was so, it was so, beyond a
doubt&#8202;&hellip;. And it made her feel strong: it seemed to her a
grace <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb258" href="#pb258" name=
"pb258">258</a>]</span>that had been accorded her, this power to live
and go on living a new life deep in her secret self, invisible to the
people outside, this power to live and love&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>She felt grateful: something sang in her like a hymn of
thanksgiving; but she was filled with compassion for Marianne. The
girl, despite Constance&rsquo; cheering words, still lay motionless
against her shoulder, with closed eyes, as though dead. Constance now
gently forced her to rise, led her away without a word &hellip; while
Bertha remained sitting, just followed them both with her dull,
indifferent eyes, then looked out at the roses in the garden, her hands
lying helplessly in her black lap.</p>
<p>Constance opened the door, led the girl into the drawing-room. The
carpet had been taken up, the curtains taken down; the furniture stood
cold and lifeless on the bare boards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marianne, darling, do listen to me now!&rdquo; Constance
forced herself to say, in a firmer voice. &ldquo;I am not angry and I
wanted to speak to you &hellip; and I have something to ask
you&#8202;&hellip;. But first tell me: do you believe that I care for
you and that anything I say and ask comes from nothing but my love for
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marianne opened her eyes:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Auntie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; said Constance, &ldquo;Van
Vreeswijck&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb259"
href="#pb259" name="pb259">259</a>]</span></p>
<p>But Marianne suddenly drew herself up where they were
sitting&mdash;she with Constance&rsquo; arms around her&mdash;nervous,
terrified, at once knowing, understanding:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Auntie, no!&rdquo; she almost screamed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marianne!&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Auntie, oh, no, no, no! I can&rsquo;t do it, I
can&rsquo;t do it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she threw herself back, sobbed out her words, as though she no
longer dared fling herself into Constance&rsquo; arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marianne, he is very fond of you &hellip; and he is such a
good fellow&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Auntie, no, no, no!&hellip; No, no, Auntie, no!&hellip; I
can&rsquo;t do it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Constance was silent. Then she said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, it&rsquo;s no, darling?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Auntie, no, no!&hellip; I don&rsquo;t care for him, I can
never, never care for him! Oh, no, no, it is cruel of you, if you ask
that of me, if you want to force me into it!&hellip; I don&rsquo;t care
for him&#8202;&hellip;. There is &hellip; there is some one
else&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was silent, stared before her like a madwoman, with the same
fixed stare as her mother. And suddenly she became very still,
accepting her anguish, and said, gently, with a heart-rending
smile:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Auntie &hellip; no. I would rather go &hellip; with Mamma
and Louise &hellip; to Baarn. We shall live very pleasantly there
&hellip; cosily, the three of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb260"
href="#pb260" name="pb260">260</a>]</span>us together&#8202;&hellip;.
Marietje will join us later, from her boarding-school&#8202;&hellip;.
Karel&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She tried to utter just a word of interest in her mother, sisters
and brothers, but her indifferent, dead voice belied her. There was
nothing in her but what had once shone from her, what was now trying to
sob from her&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>Constance clasped her in her arms:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My child!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Auntie, you will tell him, won&rsquo;t you?&hellip; Tell
him that I am sorry &hellip; but &hellip; but that I don&rsquo;t care
for him&#8202;&hellip;. I care &hellip; I care for some one
else&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And now, without speaking a word, raising her beseeching,
tear-filled eyes to her aunt&rsquo;s, she said to Constance, without
speaking a word, told her only with her beseeching glance, told her
that she loved &hellip; that she loved Uncle Henri &hellip; and that
she couldn&rsquo;t help it; that she knew it was very wrong of her;
that she begged her aunt to forgive her and implored her please not to
be angry; that she entreated only to be allowed to suffer and sob about
it; but that for the rest she hoped for nothing more from life,
nothing, nothing; that she would go quietly to Baarn, with her mother
and sisters, and try to manage to live there and pine away silently in
her grief&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>And Constance, as she held her in her arms, thought: <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb261" href="#pb261" name="pb261">261</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Living &hellip; Living&#8202;&hellip;. This child &hellip;
this poor child &hellip; is living early; and, if I have begun to live
late &hellip; O God, O God, must I also suffer as she is doing &hellip;
must I also suffer some day &hellip; soon, perhaps &hellip; if one
cannot have life without suffering?&hellip;&rdquo; <span class=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">When Constance returned home, she was even more
troubled than she had been in the morning by what she called her
dishonesty towards Van der Welcke. She lunched alone with Addie; Van
der Welcke did not come in, was evidently trying to lose himself on his
bicycle in the roads outside the Hague and lunching off a sandwich and
a glass of beer at a country inn. He did not come home till very late,
tired and dusty, and he was in an unbearable mood, as though his
surfeit of movement and speed and space had produced nothing but an
evil intoxication and not the beneficent an&aelig;sthesia which he had
expected of it. Roughly, as though dispirited and disgusted, he put
away his machine, without bestowing on it the care which he usually
gave to it after a long ride, angry with the lifeless steel which had
not consoled him, which had not shown itself a friend this time. It was
three o&rsquo;clock; and he went straight to his room to change his
clothes.</p>
<p>Constance, in her drawing-room, remained uneasy. In her heart there
was a deep pity for Marianne; and for him too an almost motherly pity,
which made her eyes fill with tears. Oh, when she had found so very
much for herself, so much that was broad and lofty, radiant and lovely,
of which she <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb263" href="#pb263" name=
"pb263">263</a>]</span>asked no more than that it should exist, exist
in soft radiance within herself, a mystic sun, a glowing mystery,
invisible to all but her, it pained her that those two, Henri and
Marianne, could find nothing for themselves and for each other!&hellip;
She listened anxiously to the sounds upstairs. She heard his footsteps
tramping overhead, heard him even throwing his clothes about, splashing
the water noisily, almost breaking the jug and basin in his savage
recklessness, his violent resentment against everything. It all
reechoed in her; she kept on starting: there he was flinging his boots
across the room; bang went the door of his wardrobe; and, when he had
finished, she heard him go to his den. Everything became still; the
warmth of the summer afternoon floated in through the open windows; a
heat mist hung over the garden of the little villa; in the kitchen, the
maid was droning out a sentimental song, in a dreary
monotone&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>Constance&rsquo; uneasiness increased. Yes, she must, she must tell
him something: she almost became frightened at the idea of telling him
nothing, of concealing from him entirely that Van Vreeswijck had asked
her to go to Marianne. And yet nothing compelled her to say anything to
Henri; and it would perhaps not even, she thought, be fair to Van
Vreeswijck. She did not know; her thoughts rambled on uneasily. But
persistently, as though from out of the new, fresh youth that was hers,
one idea <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb264" href="#pb264" name=
"pb264">264</a>]</span>obtruded itself: it would not be honest to tell
Henri nothing, not even a casual word, so that at any rate he should
not imagine, if he came to hear later, that she had been plotting
behind his back&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, the anxiety, the uneasiness became so great in her
that she rose, impulsively, and went upstairs. The servant was droning
sentimentally. Constance quietly opened the door of Henri&rsquo;s
little den. He was sitting in a chair, with his arms hanging down
beside him; he was not even smoking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am I disturbing you?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;I should like
to speak to you for a moment&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He gave her a sharp look. Usually, when she came in like that, it
meant that she had something to reproach him with, that she was
spoiling for a scene &hellip; about a trifle, sometimes about nothing.
She would come in then with the same words; and her voice at once
sounded aggressive. This time, though she tried to speak gently, her
voice, because of her uneasiness and anxiety, sounded harsh and
discordant; and he, with his irritated nerves, seemed to hear the
aggressive note, the prelude to a scene. It was as though his nerves at
once became set, as though he were pulling himself together in
self-defence:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it now?&rdquo; he asked, roughly.</p>
<p>She sat down, outwardly calm, inwardly trembling, anxious, uneasy.
And she made an effort to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb265" href=
"#pb265" name="pb265">265</a>]</span>clear her hoarse voice and to
speak calmly &hellip; so that he might know:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she began, reflectively, wishing to show him at
once that she had not come to make reproaches, that she did not wish to
make a scene, &ldquo;I wanted to speak to you &hellip; to ask your
advice&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her voice, now under control, sounded soft, as she wished it; and he
was astonished for a second, just remembered, almost unconsciously,
that she had not been so quick-tempered lately, that in fact they had
not had a scene for weeks. Still he continued suspicious: she, who
never asked his advice! And he echoed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;To ask my advice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she went on, in that same calm, reflective tone,
with a certain constraint, &ldquo;I wanted to tell you&mdash;what do
you think?&mdash;Vreeswijck stayed talking to me for a long time
yesterday evening &hellip; and he wanted
absolutely&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wanted what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She saw him turn pale; his eyes blazed angrily, as though sparks
were flashing from that vivid blue, generally so young and boyish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He would so much like &hellip; he asked
me&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She could not get the words out, looked at him, afraid of his eyes,
now that she was in no mood for a scene of mutual recrimination. But
she could not keep silent either: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb266"
href="#pb266" name="pb266">266</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;He asked me &hellip; if I thought &hellip; that
Marianne&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She saw him give a shiver. He understood it all. Nevertheless, she
went on:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That Marianne could get to care for him&#8202;&hellip;. He
asked me to go to Bertha &hellip; and ask
her&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Van Vreeswijck? Marianne?&rdquo; he repeated; and his eyes
were almost black. &ldquo;Asked you &hellip; to go to Bertha?&hellip;
Well, you&rsquo;re not mixing yourself up in it, are you? You&rsquo;re
not going, surely?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I went this morning,&rdquo; she said; and her voice once more
sounded discordant.</p>
<p>He seemed to hear a hostile note in it. And, unable to contain
himself, he flew into a passion:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You went? You went this morning?&rdquo; he raved; and even in
his raving she saw the suffering. &ldquo;Why need you mix yourself up
in it? What business has Van Vreeswijck to come asking you?&hellip; Van
Vreeswijck&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He could not find the words. All that he could get out was a rough
word, cruel, hard and insulting:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plotting and scheming &hellip; if you want to go
plotting&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her eyes flamed; she felt his intention to insult her. But his
suffering was so obvious, she saw him so plainly writhing under his
pain, that the angry <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb267" href="#pb267"
name="pb267">267</a>]</span>tempest died down at once and she merely
said, very gently:</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has refused him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked at her. The black cloud lifted from his eyes, which turned
blue again, and his gloomy frown gave way to his usual boyish
expression, full of wide-eyed astonishment now. His features relaxed,
his whole body relaxed; he gave a shiver and sat down, as though all
his temper and rage were subsiding like a sudden storm that had arisen
for no reason at all. And he asked, slowly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;She &hellip; has refused him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Of course, Bertha had nothing against it. But Marianne,
when I spoke to her, declined at once. I did not insist. Poor
Vreeswijck!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, poor fellow!&rdquo; he said, mechanically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wanted to tell you, because &hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because Vreeswijck is a friend and I thought it better that
you should know. I meant to tell you this morning, before I started.
But you went out&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked at her again, with a keen glance, wondering if she was
sincere or if there was anything behind her words; wondering what she
thought, knew or guessed about him and Marianne; what she would really
have liked; if it was a disappointment to her that Marianne had
declined so promptly: so promptly that Constance had not insisted for a
moment. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb268" href="#pb268" name=
"pb268">268</a>]</span>But she was so calm and gentle, as she stood
leaning against his table, that he found her incomprehensible and was
only conscious of breathing again after that first moment when it had
seemed to him that his throat, lungs, chest and heart were all gripped
in one hideous constriction.</p>
<p>They were silent, she standing there and he looking at her, with his
keen glance. A heat haze hung over the garden; the heavy summer scent
floated up to them; from the kitchen came the monotonous voice of the
housemaid droning out her love-song. And suddenly a sort of remorse
loomed as a spectre before Constance, because she had fettered him to
her life, for all his life, years ago; because she had fettered him to
her then by accepting his sacrifice and that of his parents in her
despair and helplessness, reviled outcast as she then was. It flashed
before her: the recollection of that day when he came to her in
Florence, when he made his gift of himself to her, made it
despairingly, feeling even then perhaps, despite the forced
love-illusion of passion, the life-long mistake which they were
mutually making. She had accepted his gift, taken his youth; she had
rendered him aimless, him and his life, his career and his happiness:
all that he might perhaps yet have found. It flashed before her again:
the recollection of that good-looking boy, the way he had come to her
in Florence and the way she had taken everything, without having
anything to give <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb269" href="#pb269"
name="pb269">269</a>]</span>him in exchange. Oh, how the past oppressed
her now, how it hung round her shoulders, crushing her like a nightmare
that was not to be shaken off, like the embrace of some leering
monster! Oh, the remorse, the remorse that was beginning to torture
her!</p>
<p>She stared before her as she stood leaning against the table; and
beads of perspiration began to come out on her forehead in the small,
warm room, full of summer haze. He continued to look at her,
penetratingly. And suddenly he heard her voice speak his name:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Henri&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did not answer, thought her strange, did not recognize her; and
again he wondered what she thought, guessed or knew &hellip; and what
else she wanted to say. But she, while a sweat of fear broke from her,
made a great inward effort to release herself from the oppression of
her past and her remorse, to be once more the woman that she had
become: the woman young again; the woman whose life was beginning for
the first time; the woman who thought, dreamed and loved; the woman in
whom nowadays the thoughts and dreams sometimes darted and darted like
multitudes of laughing butterfly fancies, swiftly, swiftly in front of
them; the woman who loved so deeply that she floated in ecstasy as in
the mystic sun of herself. Did she not now see farther than the usual
little circle which <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb270" href="#pb270"
name="pb270">270</a>]</span>had bounded her vision for years: the
little circle of the little prejudices, the little moralities, the
little follies; the little circle in which all the others&mdash;her own
people, people like herself, the small people&mdash;felt happy and
comfortable with their little philosophies, their little religions,
their little dogmas? Had she not, for weeks and months past, been
contemplating more distant prospects, all the distant cities of light
on the horizons above which sailed the spacious cloud-worlds and across
which shot the revealing lightning-flashes? In the love which she had
already confessed to herself so honestly that it etherealized into
sheer ecstasy, had she not risen above all that was still left in her
and about her of prejudice and insincerity, that sneering at herself
and others, with all the rest of that feeble cynicism? If she wanted to
live, must she not be honest, honest in all things? Oh, she
felt&mdash;in these thoughts which rushed through her mind in those few
seconds while she leant against the table, her forehead bedewed with
heat and excitement&mdash;that she was shaking off the nightmare of the
past and that, if she felt remorse, she must also try to give back what
she had taken &hellip; and what had never belonged to her, because it
had never been her right, because it had never been her happiness, any
more than his, nor her life, any more than his life! No, she had grown
out of that prejudice, the horror of making herself ridiculous; and
what she had stolen she <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb271" href=
"#pb271" name="pb271">271</a>]</span>would like to give back now
&hellip; in so far as was possible to her!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Henri,&rdquo; she repeated, for her whole thought had rushed
through her in those two or three seconds, &ldquo;there is something
more I want to say to you. I should like to talk frankly to you.
Promise me to keep calm; and do not let us lose our tempers. It is not
necessary to lose our tempers, Henri, in order to understand each other
at last&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been thinking a great deal lately,&rdquo; she
continued, turning her steady eyes towards him. &ldquo;I have been
thinking a very great deal, about our life, about both our lives
&hellip; and about the mistake we made&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He became impatient:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What on earth are you driving at and what is it all
about?&rdquo; he asked, with an irritable shake of his shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, Henri,&rdquo; she said, gently, &ldquo;let us talk for
once, for once in our lives, and be quite frank and serious. Our life
has been a mistake. And the fault&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is mine, I suppose?&rdquo; he broke in, angrily,
aggressively, working himself up for the scene which he foresaw.</p>
<p>She looked at him long and deeply and then said, firmly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fault is mine.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb272" href="#pb272" name="pb272">272</a>]</span></p>
<p>He remained silent, again shook his shoulders, restlessly, not
understanding her, not recognizing her at all. This woman was now a
stranger to him; and, above all, her calm seriousness confused him: he
would almost have preferred that she should fly out at him and have
done with it and tell him that he had no business to go bicycling alone
with Marianne.</p>
<p>But she did not do this, she merely repeated, calmly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fault is mine. The fault, the blame is mine alone, Henri.
I ought not, in Florence, to have accepted the sacrifice which you made
for me, which your father and mother made for me. It was my fault that
your life did not become &hellip; what it might have been.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes, she was frank and calm: he had to admit that; and it was not a
crafty prelude leading up to one of her angry scenes. She was speaking
so quietly and gently; her voice had a note of sorrowful humility that
almost touched him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what are you driving at?&rdquo; he said, nevertheless, in
a voice that was still nervous and jerky. &ldquo;You are very frank and
honest in looking at things like that; but what is the use of it all
now? It is so long ago. It is the past. And it was my duty then to make
up for the wrong which I had done you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had done you quite as great a wrong, Henri. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb273" href="#pb273" name="pb273">273</a>]</span>I
should not have accepted your sacrifice. I ought not to have become
your wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what would you have done then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should have gone away, somewhere or other. If I had been
then the woman that I am now, I should have gone away, somewhere or
other. And I should have left you to your life &hellip; and to the
happiness that was perhaps awaiting you
elsewhere&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should have had to give up the service just the
same&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you would have been freer without me. You were still so
young: you had your whole life before you; and you would perhaps have
found your happiness. As it is, you have never found it &hellip; or
&hellip; perhaps too late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stood up, very restless and nervous, and his boyish eyes pleaded
anxiously:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Constance, I can&rsquo;t talk in this way. I&rsquo;m not used
to it&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you face things seriously for a
moment?&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I can&rsquo;t. It upsets me. I don&rsquo;t know: you mean
to be nice, I believe, but please don&rsquo;t let us talk like this.
We&rsquo;re not accustomed to it. And I &hellip; I can&rsquo;t do it.
You can see for yourself, it upsets me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; she said, in a motherly tone, &ldquo;you are not
so much upset as all that. You can have a <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb274" href="#pb274" name="pb274">274</a>]</span>bicycle-ride
afterwards and you will feel better. But first let us talk seriously
for a moment&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sighed, sank into his chair, submitted to her stronger will. If
only she had flown out at him, he would have stormed back at her; but
she was saying such strange things, the sort of things that people
never said, and she was so calm and frank about it, calmer and franker
than people ever were.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will listen seriously for a moment? Well, what I want to
ask you is this: have you never thought that it would be better
&hellip; if we just quietly separated, Henri?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said nothing, looked at her with his great wondering eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is certainly very late,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;very late
for me to propose it. But it is perhaps not too late&#8202;&hellip;.
Let us be honest, Henri: we have never been happy together. You might
perhaps still be happy without me, released from me,
free&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He continued to look at her, his eyes still full of amazement; and
it seemed as though he was afraid to turn his gaze towards a life of
such transcendent peace and quietness and sincerity. It seemed to him
that she was urging him to take a road which grew fainter and fainter
as it took its mystic, winding way towards clouds &hellip; towards
things that did not exist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I?&hellip; Happy?&rdquo; he stammered, not knowing what to
say. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb275" href="#pb275" name=
"pb275">275</a>]</span></p>
<p>But a more concrete thought now came into his mind:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Addie?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not forgetting him,&rdquo; she said, gently. &ldquo;He
is the child of both of us, whom we both love. If we quietly &hellip;
quietly separate, if you become happy later, he will be able to
understand that his parents, however passionately they both loved him,
separated because it was better that they should. He need not suffer
through it. He will not suffer through it. At least, I like to think
that he will not. If we are only honest, Henri, he cannot suffer
through it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you &hellip; what would you do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She blushed, but did not lose her composure; he did not see her
blush. She had not yet thought of herself for a moment: she was
thinking, had been thinking, after that wave of remorse and after
holding Marianne that morning in her arms, only of him and Marianne, of
their happiness, his and Marianne&rsquo;s, even though she did not
mention the girl&rsquo;s name again, once she had told him that
Marianne had refused Van Vreeswijck. She was thinking only of the two
of them&#8202;&hellip;. What would she do? She did not know. Her love,
it is true, rose radiantly before her: her love, her new life; but she
was not thinking of outward change. Life, the real life, was an inward
thing; outwardly she was the mother of her son and would remain
so&#8202;&hellip;. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb276" href="#pb276"
name="pb276">276</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Nothing. I should simply stay as
I am. Addie could be with us in turns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would distress him, Constance&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps, at first&#8202;&hellip;. But he would soon
understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Constance, tell me, why are you speaking like
this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In what way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you really mean, Constance? What do you mean by my
happiness?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only what I say, Henri: that you may still be able to find
your happiness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are frank,&rdquo; he said, forcing himself to adopt her
tone, though it was difficult for him to speak like that. &ldquo;You
are frank. I will also try to be frank. My happiness? You speak of my
happiness?&hellip; I am too old to find that now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you are not old. You are young.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I &hellip; am old. But there is no question about me. I am
thinking &hellip; of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked at him and he suddenly understood her. He understood her,
but he writhed under so much frankness and at seeing life so
honestly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, Constance,&rdquo; he mumbled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think it over,&rdquo; she said, gently. &ldquo;If you like
&hellip; I will agree. Only &hellip; let us do it quietly, Henri,
&hellip; let us do it, if possible, with something of affection for
each other.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb277" href="#pb277"
name="pb277">277</a>]</span></p>
<p>Her eyes filled with tears. He was very much moved:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Constance, no,&rdquo; he mumbled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Henri, have the courage to be honest. Have the courage and do
not be weak. Be a man. I am only a woman and I have the
courage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Constance, people &hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Henri, you must not hesitate because of people. If we
cannot do it, it would be because of Addie. But I like to think that,
if he understands, he will not suffer through it. He <i>must</i> not
suffer through it: that would be selfish of him; and he is not
selfish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Constance, no!&rdquo; he protested again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think it over, Henri,&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;Think it
all out. I shall think of Addie also. You know how passionately devoted
I am to him. But &hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Constance, it is all too late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But think it over, Henri.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, Constance, I shall &hellip; I shall think it
over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, if we decide upon it &hellip; let us do it &hellip; let
us decide to do it with something of affection for each other
&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Constance &hellip; yes, with affection &hellip; You are
nice &hellip; you are kind &hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked at her, his chest heaving with emotion; a haze dimmed the
boyish glance of his eyes. She had meant to go, quietly, to leave him
alone. She <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb278" href="#pb278" name=
"pb278">278</a>]</span>went to the door, without another word, another
look, wishing to leave him alone with his thoughts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Constance!&rdquo; he cried, hoarsely.</p>
<p>She looked round. He was standing before her; and she saw him
quivering, trembling with the emotion, the shock which the reality of
life had sent shuddering through him. For a moment they stood in front
of each other; and, because they saw into each other&rsquo;s eyes, they
told each other once more&mdash;silently, without words&mdash;that they
understood each other! A great gratitude, an emotion that to him was
almost superhuman shot through his small soul and flowed over her. And,
impotently, he cried once more, like a man in a fever:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Constance!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He flung himself, distractedly, desperately, with a wild impulse,
into her arms; bursting into sobs, he buried his head in her breast.
She started violently; she felt his convulsive tremors against her
heart. Then she threw her arm around him, stroked his hair. It was as
though she were comforting her son.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am mad, I am mad!&rdquo; he muttered.</p>
<p>He released himself, hurriedly pressed a quivering kiss on her
forehead and tore down the stairs. And, when she went down to her
drawing-room, she suddenly heard the front-door slam and saw him
bicycling away like a madman, his back arched like a
professional&rsquo;s. He pedalled, pedalled furiously: <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb279" href="#pb279" name="pb279">279</a>]</span>she
watched him lose himself &hellip; in movement, speed and space
&hellip;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor boy!&rdquo; she thought.</p>
<p>Then she sank into a chair, while the room swam round her. She
closed her eyes and her hands fell limply at her side. So she sat for
half an hour, unconscious, alone &hellip; as if the new life had been
too keen, too intense, with its pure air, its honesty &hellip; too rare
and keen in its cold-blue ether &hellip; and as if she were swooning
away in it&#8202;&hellip;. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb280" href=

<h2 class="main">Chapter XXVII</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">She came to herself with a start and did not know
whether she had been unconscious or asleep. At the same moment, she
heard the bell and through the curtain she saw Brauws, standing outside
the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is he, it is he!&rdquo; an exultant voice cried inside
her.</p>
<p>But at the same time she felt too nervous and overwrought to receive
him, just ordinarily and naturally. She stopped Truitje in the hall,
said that she had a headache and the girl must say not at home; and she
fled to her bedroom and locked herself in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was he, it was he!&rdquo; the voice still sang, almost
sorrowfully.</p>
<p>But she could not have talked ordinarily and
naturally&#8202;&hellip;. Suddenly she did what she had not yet done
that day: she thought of herself. If they were to separate, Henri and
she, then she herself would be free!&hellip; Free! A violent longing
surged up in her to see Brauws, to speak to him, to say just one word
to him, to ask his advice, to abandon herself, as it were, to that
advice!&hellip; At this moment, for the first time, the thought
occurred to her that he must love her too. Would he come so often, if
not? Would he speak as he did, reveal himself <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb281" href="#pb281" name="pb281">281</a>]</span>so
completely, otherwise? Would he otherwise &hellip; she did not know
what; but, as she recalled him since he returned from Switzerland, she
felt, indeed she was certain that his whole being was permeated with
love for her &hellip; a love that was strangely akin to regret, but
still love &hellip; Was her love regret? No&#8202;&hellip;. Was her
love hope? No, not hope either&#8202;&hellip;. Her love, hers, was only
life, had hitherto been only life: the lives which another woman lives
from her eighteenth year onwards she had as it were hastened to live
now, late as it was. Oh, to live right on from those first young
girlish dreams which had danced along radiant paths towards the high
clouds above her &hellip; while all the time her incredulous little
laugh had tempered their eager joy!&hellip; But now, since she had
spoken to Van der Welcke, now, suddenly, since she had awakened from
her sleep or her swoon after that breath of pure ether, that perfect
sincerity, now she felt that her love was not only just existence, just
life&mdash;the real existence, the real life&mdash;but that the most
human emotions were suddenly passing through her soul; that she herself
regretted what might have been; that she herself hoped&mdash;O
Heaven!&mdash;for what might yet be. It was suddenly as though all her
past had fallen from her and as though she saw a number of new paths
winding towards new years, towards the wide fields of the future,
nothing but the future. It was as though <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb282" href="#pb282" name="pb282">282</a>]</span>this new inner life
of thinking and feeling, this new life of her soul, were also about to
begin a new actual life, a life of fresh seasons, which lay spread
before her broad and generous as summer and towards which she would fly
in joyous haste, because it was already so late &hellip; but not yet
too late, not yet too late&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>She thought of herself, for the first time that day; and a violent
emotion throbbed within her, almost taking away her breath. Henri would
be back presently: would he tell her that that was best, that they
would separate, with still something of affection and gratitude for
each other, heedless of people and of everything that made up their
world, because they were at last entitled to their own happiness, to
the happiness of their own souls and to the happiness of those who
loved them really? They would shake from them all that had been
falsehood during all those long, long years; and they would now be
true, honest with themselves and with every one; and they would be
happy&#8202;&hellip;. It was as if these dreams were already lifting
her up out of the ring of falsehood, the ring of small people, small
souls. Sitting there in her chair, she hid her face in her hands,
compressed her closed eyes until, in their blindness, they saw all the
colours of the rainbow flashing before them &hellip; so as not to see
her room, so as to see nothing but her dreams&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mamma!&hellip;&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb283"
href="#pb283" name="pb283">283</a>]</span></p>
<p>She started: it was Addie come home. And the start which she gave
was a violent one, for she had forgotten him; and a quick compunction
shot through those last flashes. She had forgotten him; and yet time
after time she had said to herself that she must speak to him as if he
were a man.</p>
<p>She now called to him to come in, for he always looked in on her
when he returned from school in the afternoon. And, when she saw him,
she felt as if she were waking from a dream. Still the violent emotion
continued to throb in her; and she felt that she could not be silent.
She began, at once:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Addie, I have been talking to Papa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was impossible for her to go on. Not until he sat down beside
her, took her hand in his, did she continue, with difficulty:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Addie, would it make you very unhappy &hellip; if
&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If what, Mamma?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we, Papa and I &hellip; quite quietly, Addie &hellip;
without any bitterness &hellip; were to separate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He started inwardly, but remained outwardly calm. He knew the
struggle that was going on in both of them. Had he not constantly heard
his father&rsquo;s name mixed up with Marianne&rsquo;s? Did he not know
and had not he&mdash;he alone, within himself, without even letting his
mother notice it&mdash;had he not guessed the real reason why Mamma had
had a different <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb284" href="#pb284"
name="pb284">284</a>]</span>expression, a different voice, a different
step during the last few months? Did he not feel what prompted her to
go for long, long walks&mdash;sometimes with him, sometimes
alone&mdash;over the dunes, towards the sea?&hellip; Though he did not
know her new life, he had guessed her love&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>There was a buzzing in his ears as she talked, as she explained to
him how it would be better like that, for Papa, and how they both loved
him, their child. She mentioned no names, neither Marianne&rsquo;s nor
Brauws&rsquo;. He remained quiet; and she did not see what was passing
within him, not even when he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you think &hellip; if Papa is of opinion &hellip; that it
will be better so, Mamma&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She went on speaking, while her heart throbbed violently with the
force of her emotion. She spoke of honesty and sincerity &hellip; of
happiness for Papa &hellip; perhaps. A curious shyness made her shrink
from speaking of herself. He hardly heard her words. But he understood
her: he understood what she actually wanted, the future which she
wished to bring about and compel. But a passion of melancholy
overwhelmed him and his heart was weighed down with grief. He heard her
speak of her life&mdash;his father&rsquo;s and hers&mdash;as a chain, a
yoke, a lie. He felt dimly that she perhaps was right; and the light of
those glowing dreams of hers made something shine vaguely before his
childish eyes. But he found in it only sadness; and his <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb285" href="#pb285" name=
"pb285">285</a>]</span>heart was still heavy with grief. He was their
child; and it seemed as though something in his soul would be rent
asunder if they separated, even though their life together was a lie, a
chain, a yoke. He tried to weigh those words, to sound their depths, to
feel them. But it was only his sadness that he measured, only the depth
of his own sorrow. If they were to separate, his parents whom he loved
so well, both of them, each of them, whom he had learnt to love so well
just perhaps because they did not love each other, then his love, so it
suddenly appeared to him, was something which they could both do
without, something of no value, to either of them. That was how he felt
it, though he could not have put it into words; and he felt it even
more profoundly than any words could have expressed&#8202;&hellip;. But
she noticed nothing in him. It was not the first time that he had felt
the cruelty of life, even towards a child, a boy; and it was not his
nature to show weakness. That other time, after his childish soul had
suffered so grievously, when he had doubted whether he was his
father&rsquo;s son, he had resolved to triumph over life&rsquo;s
cruelties and not to show anything and to be strong. Now the moment
seemed to have come. He remembered his first great trouble, he
remembered his resolve: the resolve to be always strong after that
first childish weakness; and he was able to repeat, calmly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you think &hellip; that it will be better for both
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb286" href="#pb286" name=
"pb286">286</a>]</span>of you, Mamma &hellip; then it is not for me to
object&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She thought him almost cold; but he kissed her, said that he,
whatever happened, would remain the child and the son of both of them,
that he would love them both, equally&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>But, because of that coldness, the shadow of a doubt suddenly
crossed her mind; and it seemed as though her dreams grew dark and
cloudy&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Addie,&rdquo; she asked again, &ldquo;tell me frankly, tell
me honestly that I am right, that it will be a good thing &hellip; for
Papa&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And for you?&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And for me,&rdquo; she echoed; and he saw her blush.
&ldquo;Or &hellip; or, Addie, my boy, my darling, is &hellip; is it all
too late? Is it too late &hellip; for Papa&rsquo;s
happiness?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And for yours too, you mean&#8202;&hellip;. Too late? Why
should it be too late?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked at him, thought him hard, but guessed that he was
suffering more than he was willing to admit&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought first &hellip; of Papa&rsquo;s happiness,
Addie,&rdquo; she said, softly. &ldquo;Because Papa has never been
happy with me &hellip; with me who took everything from him and gave
him nothing in return, I thought first of all &hellip; of Papa&rsquo;s
happiness and afterwards &hellip; afterwards&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Afterwards&#8202;&hellip;?&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb287" href="#pb287" name="pb287">287</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Addie, then I thought &hellip; of my own! But perhaps it
is not all as I picture it, Addie &hellip; and perhaps it is all too
late&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he took her in his arms; and she felt his young, sturdy, boyish
body against hers, felt it all at once, as a pillar of strength.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too late? Why should it be, Mamma? Let us first hear what
Papa thinks. Too late? No, Mamma. If you see it in this light for the
first time now, why &hellip; why should it be too late?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She threw her arms round his neck and laid her head on his
shoulder:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, dear. I thought &hellip; I thought that
it would be a good thing &hellip; for everybody &hellip; for all of us
&hellip; Perhaps I am wrong. I can&rsquo;t tell&#8202;&hellip;. I am
tired, dear. Leave me here by myself. Have your dinner with Papa: I
don&rsquo;t want any dinner, I am tired, I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t come
down&#8202;&hellip;. Hark, there&rsquo;s Papa coming in. Go and tell
him that I am tired. Go now, go at once&#8202;&hellip;. I can&rsquo;t
say: perhaps it is not as I thought, Addie, and perhaps &hellip;
perhaps it is all &hellip; too late!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She saw his eyes grow softer, full of pity; he pressed her to
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Addie!&rdquo; she suddenly implored. &ldquo;Whatever I may
lose, never, never let me lose you! For all the rest is perhaps
illusion &hellip; and all too late, too late&#8202;&hellip;. But you
&hellip; you are real, you exist!&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb288" href="#pb288" name="pb288">288</a>]</span></p>
<p>She held him, clung to his strong shoulders; and he saw her very
pale, anxious-eyed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mamma&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, leave me now, my boy &hellip; leave me alone &hellip; and
go to Papa&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He kissed her once more and went away.</p>
<p>She stayed behind, looked at herself in the glass. She saw herself,
after all this emotion, saw her pale face, her grey hair:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;Oh, to live
really, I must not &hellip; I must not think of myself!&hellip; For me
&hellip; it is all too late! If it has to be so, if we separate, it
must be only &hellip; only for him, for Henri &hellip; and for &hellip;
and for Marianne!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She sank into her chair, covered her face, kept her eyes tightly
closed; but their blindness no longer saw the rainbow-colours flashing
before them&#8202;&hellip;. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb289" href=

<h2 class="main">Chapter XXVIII</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Addie, downstairs, helped his father with the bicycle,
took it for him to the little room by the kitchen, promised Papa to see
to it for him in the morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am I late for dinner?&rdquo; asked Van der Welcke.</p>
<p>He was tired and hot; his clothes were sticking to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mamma has a head-ache,&rdquo; said Addie. &ldquo;Go and
change your things first: dinner can wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Van der Welcke dragged himself upstairs. He had bicycled so hard
that day&mdash;both morning and afternoon&mdash;with his eyes fixed in
front of him, his thoughts fixed in front of him, that his body was
tingling with weariness, his eyes blind with that fixed staring, as if
they had been full of dust and sand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come and help me,&rdquo; he said to Addie.</p>
<p>And, going to the bathroom, he flung off all his clothes and took a
shower-bath, while Addie brought him fresh things.</p>
<p>He was ready in ten minutes, doing everything in a feverish, tired
hurry:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now we can have dinner. Isn&rsquo;t Mamma coming
down?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They sat down opposite each other, but Van der <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb290" href="#pb290" name=
"pb290">290</a>]</span>Welcke was not hungry, did not eat. The servant
took something up to Constance. Dinner was over in a quarter of an
hour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <i>am</i> tired!&rdquo; Van der Welcke confessed.</p>
<p>The maid had soon cleared the table. And they remained in the
dining-room, which was now growing dark.</p>
<p>The French windows were open and the sultry evening filled the room.
Van der Welcke, who had thrown himself into a chair, got up restlessly,
strode into the garden, came back again. When he saw Addie sitting
quietly on the sofa, he flung himself beside him, laid his head on the
boy&rsquo;s knees. Then, with a deep sigh, he fell asleep, almost
immediately.</p>
<p>Addie sat without moving, let his father sleep there, with his head
on his son&rsquo;s knees.</p>
<p>From another villa, a stream of yellow light flowed across the
garden and cast dim shadows in the dark dining-room. And in the kitchen
the maid went on drearily humming the same tune as in the afternoon, as
though she were humming unconsciously.</p>
<p>The boy sat still, with set lips, looking down at his father, whose
chest rose and fell peacefully, with the deep breathing which Addie
felt against his hand&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>That afternoon, those two, his father and mother, had spoken to each
other, for the first time, seriously, in truth and sincerity, as his
mother had told him. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb291" href="#pb291"
name="pb291">291</a>]</span>And now the thought was whirling in both
their minds that, after years and years of wretchedness and disunion,
they were going to separate after all! For Papa&rsquo;s happiness,
Mamma had said; and Addie believed that that was how she meant it.</p>
<p>Apart from this, there had been no names mentioned; but Addie knew
that both Mamma and Papa, that afternoon, had thought&mdash;as he was
thinking now&mdash;had thought, behind their spoken words, of Marianne.
And now jealousy&mdash;that heritage from both his parents&mdash;sprang
up in the boy&rsquo;s breast, jealousy no longer vague and formless. He
felt it with a keener pang because Papa, at this moment, cared more for
Marianne than for him. He felt too, for the first time, that, though he
did not mean to, he loved his father better than his mother: his father
who was like a child, who was himself a boy, a brother, a friend to
him, something more than a father almost. In their brotherly
comradeship, they had seemed gradually to lose sight of the difference
in age, of filial respect; and in Addie&rsquo;s love for his father
there was an element&mdash;not yet fully developed, but slowly
gathering strength&mdash;of protection almost, a feeling that he was
perhaps not yet the stronger, but that he would become so when he was a
little older. It was a strange feeling, but it had always come natural
to him, that way of looking upon his father as a younger brother to be
loved and protected. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb292" href="#pb292"
name="pb292">292</a>]</span></p>
<p>It was perhaps all for nothing, useless, he thought, and worthless.
It was Marianne that Papa cared for now. And he remembered how he had
sometimes thought that Papa was so young that one could imagine him
with a very young wife, a young girl like Addie&rsquo;s cousins, a girl
like &hellip; Marianne.</p>
<p>So it was to happen &hellip; Papa and Mamma &hellip; would separate
&hellip; and&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>He felt the sadness of it all &hellip; and his heart was very heavy
&hellip; and his lips became still more compressed because he did not
want to cry. He wanted to stand firm against the cruelties of life;
and, if Papa could do without him, if Mamma also thought it better so,
if perhaps it was also better for Mamma and would make her happier,
why, then it was all right and he could bear it with strength and
fortitude. He was a child, a boy; but he felt vaguely that soon the
world would open before him. He must forget everything therefore:
everything about his parents, their ill-assorted lives, in which he had
been the only comfort and consolation. No, it would all be different in
future; and, if nothing else could be done, well then, it must be like
that. When Papa, later on, was tired or in the blues or anything, he
would not lay his head on Addie&rsquo;s knees, just like a little
brother, and go to sleep: Marianne would comfort him instead.</p>
<p>Addie tried to suppress that feeling of jealousy, but it kept on
shooting through him, like a painful, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb293" href="#pb293" name="pb293">293</a>]</span>smarting
sting&#8202;&hellip;. But suddenly, in the dark room, in the silent
house&mdash;the servant was no longer singing&mdash;Van der Welcke
woke, drew himself up, rubbed his neck, which was stiff with lying
down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ve had a good long nap!&rdquo; said Addie,
making his voice sound rough.</p>
<p>There was nothing in that voice and in the boyish phrase to suggest
the jealousy, the melancholy and the great sorrow that was weighing
down his childish soul.</p>
<p>Van der Welcke seemed to be waking up to life and reality after his
vain attempt to lose himself in that mad devouring of distance. He
remembered his conversation with his wife, in which she had been so
unusually gentle, so indulgent, showing such self-effacement and
self-sacrifice &hellip; so much indeed that he had had to kiss her in
spite of himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been speaking to Mamma,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>But he was silent again, could get no further.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So have I,&rdquo; said Addie, to make it easier for him.</p>
<p>But he also did not know what to say; and they remained sitting side
by side in the dark dining-room, both staring at the shaft of yellow
light that streamed across the garden from the villa at the back. Each
now knew, however, that the other knew; and Addie threw his arm over
his father&rsquo;s shoulder, almost protectingly. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb294" href="#pb294" name="pb294">294</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;It is an idea of Mamma&rsquo;s, Addie &hellip; that it would
be better&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For both of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For me, Mamma thought.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And for her too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you, my boy, what would you think &hellip; if it did come
to that &hellip; at last?&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you both consider &hellip; calmly and dispassionately
&hellip; that it would be a good thing&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you, you would spend a part of the year with Mamma and a
part with me&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re taking it very coolly, Addie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad, what else is there to do? If it&rsquo;s better like that
&hellip; for the two of you &hellip; I&rsquo;m bound to think it all
right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you can talk like that, it&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;re
not so fond of us&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m just as fond of you: of Mamma, Dad, and of you.
But, if it&rsquo;s got to be, it&rsquo;s got to
be&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s strange, Addie, how everything suddenly, one fine
day, seems likely to become different&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mamma saw it like that&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Mamma has changed lately, don&rsquo;t you
think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mamma has become rather gentler, not so
quick-tempered.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb295" href=
"#pb295" name="pb295">295</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, not so quick-tempered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s all. Tell me, Addie, tell me honestly: do
people, as far as you know, still &hellip; talk about us &hellip; as
much as they did?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Dad. I don&rsquo;t bother about
&lsquo;people.&rsquo; I just go to school, you see. But I
think&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do they talk about Mamma?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never hear anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They talk about me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, they talk about you, Dad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do they say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They talk of you, Dad, and&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marianne.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is going to Baarn &hellip; and then we
sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t see each other any more. People are always ready to
jabber &hellip; because I&rsquo;ve gone cycling and motoring &hellip;
with Marianne.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was as though he were confessing and denying in the same
breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Addie,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;I cycled a great way
to-day.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb296" href="#pb296" name=
"pb296">296</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Dad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can always think best when I&rsquo;m cycling like
mad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Dad, I know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I&rsquo;m scorching along the roads, like a lunatic, I
can think. At any other time, I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I thought a great deal to-day, Addie. As a rule, I never
think about anything. It tired me to-day even more than the cycling
itself. I&rsquo;m tremendously tired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Dad, go to bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I want to talk to you. I want to sit with you like this.
You&rsquo;re my friend, aren&rsquo;t you, your father&rsquo;s friend?
Or aren&rsquo;t you that any longer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re so cold, Addie, you don&rsquo;t care a
bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Dad, I do care.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he pulled Van der Welcke to him and pressed his father&rsquo;s
head against his chest:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lie like that now and talk away. I do care.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought a great deal, Addie, cycling. This morning, I was
angry, furious, desperate. I could have done something violent, broken
something, murdered somebody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, come!&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, murdered &hellip; I don&rsquo;t know whom &hellip; I
felt, Addie, that I could have become very happy
if&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb297" href=
"#pb297" name="pb297">297</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Dad, I know&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You understand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I came home, I was tired and mad with misery. Mamma came
upstairs and talked to me. She told me that Van Vreeswijck &hellip; had
asked her to go to the Bezuidenhout and speak to Aunt Bertha &hellip;
and to Marianne, because Van Vreeswijck &hellip; do you
understand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Dad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mamma went. I was furious when I heard that she had been. But
she said that Marianne refused&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marianne refused him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Then &hellip; then Mamma said &hellip; then she asked
&hellip; if it wouldn&rsquo;t be better that we&mdash;she and
I&mdash;do you understand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Dad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She said it in a very nice way. She said it gently, not at
all angrily. It was nice of her to think of it, you know,
Addie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Dad, she <i>is</i> nice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, old chap, then &hellip; then I gave her a kiss &hellip;
because she was so nice about it and said it so kindly. And then
&hellip; then I went cycling again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can think best when I&rsquo;m cycling. I rode and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb298" href="#pb298" name=
"pb298">298</a>]</span>rode. Meanwhile, I was thinking, would it be a
good thing?&hellip; My boy, you are more than my son, aren&rsquo;t you:
you&rsquo;re my friend?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the time, I was thinking &hellip; of Marianne. I am fond
of her, Addie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tried to imagine it &hellip; I know &hellip; that she is
fond of me, Addie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tried to picture it &hellip; And then, Addie &hellip; then
I thought myself old. Tell me, I am old, don&rsquo;t you
think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are not old, Father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, perhaps not&#8202;&hellip;. Still, Addie, I don&rsquo;t
know, I really don&rsquo;t know&#8202;&hellip;. Then, Addie, I
thought&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of what, Dad, of whom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I went on riding, like a madman. That&rsquo;s how I think
best. Then I thought of &hellip; you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, of you&#8202;&hellip;. Tell me, my boy, if we did that
&hellip; if everything was changed &hellip; wouldn&rsquo;t you be
unhappy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it was for the happiness of both of you, no. Then I should
not be unhappy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, so you say. But you would have to be unhappy &hellip;
inside. If you still love us both. I thought it all out till I was
dog-tired. For I never <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb299" href=
"#pb299" name="pb299">299</a>]</span>think as a rule. Thinking bores
me. This time, I had to &hellip; because Mamma had spoken as she did.
Yes, you are bound to be unhappy &hellip; if you still care &hellip;
for both of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you again, Dad&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know. But I, Addie, <i>I</i> should be unhappy
&hellip; afterwards, when it had once happened &hellip; <i>I</i> should
be unhappy &hellip; because of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because of me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because of you. You would no longer have a home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should have two homes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, you would have none. You would go wandering to and
fro between your parents. True, you will soon be a man. You will soon
be leaving your parents. But I do feel now that you would have no home
and that you would have a father and a mother &hellip; but no parents.
Do you follow me? No parents. Even though they quarrel, you have
parents now. Perhaps, in a few years, you won&rsquo;t care about them
&hellip; and about their home. But just now, Addie, just for the
present, you would be losing a great deal&#8202;&hellip;. You see, old
chap, your father has thought it all out &hellip; and I frankly
confess, it&rsquo;s made me dog-tired. I&rsquo;m resting now, while I
tell it you like this, leaning up against you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Dad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My boy, my own boy!&hellip;. Well, you see, when <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb300" href="#pb300" name="pb300">300</a>]</span>your
father had got so far &hellip; then he felt&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That he cared more for you &hellip; than for Marianne, poor
darling. Differently, you know, but more. Much more. Poor
darling!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A passion of joy swept through the lad; his chest, on which his
father&rsquo;s head lay, heaved. But he felt that it was wicked to have
that joy:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad, once more, if it means your
happiness&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, old chap &hellip; for there would be something severed in
me, something broken: I don&rsquo;t know how to put it. I should miss
you all the time that you were not with me. I couldn&rsquo;t do it,
Addie. It&rsquo;s an impossibility, Addie&#8202;&hellip;. You know, old
chap, I oughtn&rsquo;t to talk like this to a son of fifteen. Fifteen?
No, you&rsquo;re only fourteen. Well, you look sixteen. But
that&rsquo;s nothing to do with it. I oughtn&rsquo;t to talk like this.
I&rsquo;m a queer father, eh, Addie? I don&rsquo;t give you a proper
upbringing: I just let you go your own way. Lord, old chap, I
can&rsquo;t do it, I can&rsquo;t give you a proper upbringing! I
shouldn&rsquo;t know how. You&rsquo;ll bring yourself up, won&rsquo;t
you? You&rsquo;re sure to be good and clever and honourable and all the
rest of it. I don&rsquo;t know how, you see: I just let you run wild,
like a colt in a meadow. Well, you promise me to turn out all right,
don&rsquo;t you? To do nothing mean and so on? You know, if Grandpapa
were to hear all this, were <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb301" href=
"#pb301" name="pb301">301</a>]</span>to hear me talking like this, he
would think it very odd. And it is odd. It&rsquo;s not right. But your
father, Addie, is like that: he&rsquo;s hopeless, quite hopeless. So
now you know all about it. I couldn&rsquo;t do it&#8202;&hellip;. Poor
Marianne, poor darling! But she&rsquo;s young still; she&rsquo;ll have
her happiness one day, a different happiness&#8202;&hellip;. Well,
Addie, tell Mamma to-morrow. Tell her I would rather, if Mamma agrees,
leave everything as it is, old chap, even though it&rsquo;s not always
a paradise, that I&rsquo;d rather leave everything as it is, old chap,
for your sake &hellip; and also for my own: I could never do without
you for six months. You may be going away quite soon: Leiden &hellip;
and then your service &hellip; but, for the present &hellip; for the
present&#8202;&hellip;. Will you tell Mamma to-morrow? Those serious
conversations make me feel so tired &hellip; in my head. I would rather
cycle for a week on end without stopping than spend one day thinking as
I have done to-day&#8202;&hellip;. And now I&rsquo;m going to bed, old
chap, for I&rsquo;m dead tired&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He caught his son in his arms, held him closely, kissed him and went
away abruptly. The boy remained alone in the dark room. The yellow
shaft of light from the other villa died away. The house was quite
silent; the servants had gone to bed. And the boy stayed on, knowing
all the time that his parents upstairs, in their own rooms, were still
separated, in spite of so much that might have united <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb302" href="#pb302" name=
"pb302">302</a>]</span>them; he sat there, still and silent, staring
out into the hot summer night, through which the trees loomed like
ghostly giants, sombre and oppressive&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>Yet his soul was flooded with a great joy: his father loved him
best! <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb303" href="#pb303" name=

<h2 class="main">Chapter XXIX</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Constance remained alone the whole evening.</p>
<p>She had opened both her bedroom-windows wide; and she looked out
over the road into the sultry night. She had undressed and put on a
white wrapper; and she remained sitting, in the dark room, at the open
window.</p>
<p>For a moment, she thought that Van der Welcke would come to her, to
tell her his decision; but he did not come&#8202;&hellip;. He seemed to
be staying with Addie in the dining-room&#8202;&hellip;. Then she heard
him go to his own room&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>In the silence, in the still, sultry darkness, which seemed to enter
the room almost heavily, her restlessness, the doubt which she had felt
rising in herself, during those few words with Addie, melted away.
Sitting at the open window, she let herself be borne along by the
silent, insidious magic of the late summer hour, as though something
stronger than herself were overpowering her and compelling her to
surrender herself, without further thinking or doubting, to a host of
almost disquieting raptures, which came crowding in upon
her&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>Above the darkling masses of the Woods hung the sullen menace of
heavy rain; and, just once or twice, there was a gleam of lightning
yonder, in the direction <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb304" href=
"#pb304" name="pb304">304</a>]</span>of the sea, which she divined in
the distance flashing with sudden illuminations, with noiseless
reflections, and then vanishing in the low-hanging clouds of the
night.</p>
<p>She lay back in her chair, at first oppressed by her doubt and by
the heat, but gradually, gradually&mdash;her eyes fixed on the electric
gleams far in the distance&mdash;all her doubts melted away, the
enchantment penetrated yet deeper and the storm-charged sultriness
seemed a languorous ecstasy in which her breast heaved gently, her lips
opened and her eyes closed, only to open again, wider than before, and
stare at the lightning that flashed and vanished, flashed and vanished,
with intervals full of mystery&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>No, she doubted no longer: all would be well, all would be
well&#8202;&hellip;. She could not make a mistake in this new life,
this later life, this mature life, which she had lived, so to speak, in
a few months, giving herself up entirely to sincerity and honesty and
to the crowning love, the only really true and lofty love. Her love,
that late love, had been her life, right from those girlish dreams of a
few months past down to the moment of inward avowal; and what in
another woman would have lasted years, in the slow falling of the days,
which, like beads on a long string, fell one by one through the fingers
of silent fate, the unrelenting teller of the beads, she had lived in a
few months: after her dreaming had come <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb305" href="#pb305" name="pb305">305</a>]</span>her thinking; after
her thinking, her wish to know; after her wish to know, her plunge into
books and nature, until dreaming, thinking, knowledge and, above all,
love supreme and triumphant had mingled to form a new existence and she
had been reborn as it were out of herself.</p>
<p>She had dreamed and thought and questioned it all hastily and
feverishly, as though afraid of being late, of feeling her senses
numbed, her soul withered by the grey years, before she had lived
&hellip; before she had lived. Hastily, but in all sincerity; and her
late awakening had been deep and intense, a mystery to herself and an
impenetrable secret to all, for no one knew that she dreamed and
thought and questioned knowledge and nature; no one knew that nowadays
she looked on a tree, a cloud, a book, a picture with different eyes
than in the past, when she had neither eyes nor understanding for tree
or cloud, for book or picture, nor found beauty in any; no one saw that
something cosmic and eternal flashed before her in that one swift
glance of tardy recognition and knowledge; no one knew that she, the
aristocrat, felt that keen pity for her day and generation, had learnt
to feel it from him, through him. All of it, all of it, all her later
life: no one knew it save herself alone&#8202;&hellip;. And gradually,
too, in those intimate conversations, they had come to know something
of each other, had learnt&mdash;guessing first and then
knowing&mdash;that they had found each other, late in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb306" href="#pb306" name=
"pb306">306</a>]</span>life&mdash;she him, he her&mdash;as though at
last, at last, after that vague instinctive seeking and trying to find
each other in their childhood days, Heaven had been merciful! How vague
it had been, that shadowy intuition, hardly to be uttered and vanishing
as soon as uttered: on his side, that distant veil of mist, that cloud,
on the horizon of the moors; on hers, that perpetual longing to go
farther, to flit from boulder to boulder down the hurrying stream, as
it rushed past under the dense canopy of those tropical trees: a pair
of children knowing nothing of each other and all unconscious until
years later that they were both seeking &hellip; both seeking! Oh, that
strange dream-quest, that nameless desire, which, when one breathed it,
vanished, was no longer a quest! At a touch, it became intangible; as
soon as one grasped it, it slipped away, became something different,
something different&#8202;&hellip;. But, unbreathed, untouched,
ungrasped, just dreamed and dimly felt in those far-off childhood days,
it was <i>that</i>: the mystic, wonderful reality, which was the only
reality&#8202;&hellip;. To both of them, in those days, it had been too
gossamer-frail, too intangible and too incomprehensible to last beyond
their childhood, that seed of reality working in the womb of time:
vanity and frivolity had claimed her for their own, study and
reflection had claimed him; and each had wandered farther and farther
from that half-divined other, no longer even seeking the
other&#8202;&hellip;. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb307" href=
"#pb307" name="pb307">307</a>]</span></p>
<p>The years had heaped themselves up between them, between her at the
Hague, in Rome, in Brussels, and him in America, when she was an
elegant young society-woman, he the workmen&rsquo;s friend and brother,
their comrade who yearned to know and understand them. While she had
danced and flirted in the ball-rooms of Rome, he had laboured in the
docks, gone down the black shafts of the coal-mines. And all this which
had really happened seemed unreal to her, a dream, a remote nightmare,
by the side of that childish romance, those fairy visions of yesterday!
And yet it had all happened, it had all happened. They had never been
allowed to meet each other, not even when they had been brought near
each other&mdash;on the Riviera, in Brussels&mdash;as by an unconscious
power! They had not been allowed to meet until now, late, very late,
too late&#8202;&hellip;. Oh, is it ever given too late, that blessed
boon, to live at last, to find at last?</p>
<p>And they had both made mistakes. She had made her mistakes: her
brief passion for Henri, the sudden kindling of the senses of a
frivolous, bored and idle woman; then the marriage: mistake upon
mistake, nothing but waste, waste, waste of her precious life. And he
had made mistakes too: he had dreamed of being the brother of those
men, a fellow-worker and comrade, and he had not become their brother.
Oh, if they had once been allowed to know and find each other, in the
years when they <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb308" href="#pb308"
name="pb308">308</a>]</span>were both young, what a harmony their life
together might have been: no jarring note in themselves or in each
other, but perfect harmony in all things, attuned to the note of their
day and generation; he by her side to understand and love her and
support her when the sadness of it all oppressed her! Oh, to have
lived, when still young, with him, in his heart, in his arms; and then
to have loved, to have understood, to have done, with him and for his
sake, all that can still be done for one&rsquo;s day and generation by
those who themselves are strong and radiant in love and happiness and
harmony!&hellip;</p>
<p>And it had not been so; the precious years, far from each other, had
been wasted &hellip; by him: he had told her so; by her: oh, her vain,
wasted years!&hellip;</p>
<p>No, fate had not willed it. And yet, now that at last, at last, the
honest, simple, true life had kindled into flame, now that, after first
thinking of others&mdash;of Henri, of Marianne&mdash;she had also
thought of herself, also thought of him, could not an outward physical
life also be kindled after that inward, spiritual life, far from
everything and everybody around them, in another country and another
world, a life in which she would be beside him, a life of harmony which
might be tinged with the melancholy of that late awakening but would
still be perfect harmony and perfect happiness?&hellip; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb309" href="#pb309" name="pb309">309</a>]</span></p>
<p>She lay back in her chair, her hands hanging limply beside her, as
if she lacked the energy now to grasp the tempting illusion, afraid of
losing it and afraid of seizing it and then recognizing it as an
illusion&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>And the sultry air seemed to be pressing upon her softly and
languorously until she panted and her lips parted and her eyes closed
only to open again, wider than before; and in that atmosphere of
ecstasy it appeared to her that the distant lightning-streaks yonder,
the noiseless flashes over the wide sea which she divined yonder,
yonder, far away, were themselves the swift effulgence of her thoughts
and illusions and regrets: a gleam and gone, a gleam and gone. When it
gleamed, came the smiling hope that things could become and remain as
she thought; when the light faded, came doubt &hellip; yet not so deep
but that the night tempted and lured her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hope again &hellip; think once more &hellip; dream
again&#8202;&hellip;. It may be &hellip; it is not
impossible&#8202;&hellip;. It is reality, pure, simple reality; it will
mean the happiness of those two poor children, Henri and Marianne; it
will be the happiness of you two, him and you, the woman whose life
blossomed late&#8202;&hellip;. It is possible: hope it again, think,
dream it again; for what is impossibility, when truth once stands
revealed, however late? See, the truth stands revealed; the lightning
flashes; sometimes the whole <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb310" href=
"#pb310" name="pb310">310</a>]</span>sky is illumined at once; the low
clouds drift along; behind them &hellip; behind them lies the infinity
of eternity, of everything that may happen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The room was quite dark; she herself alone remained a white blur in
the window-frame; and the night, the air, the lights were there
outside, wide and eternal. And, in the sweet languor of the late summer
hour, of the sultry night, of her uncontrollable illusion and hopes,
she felt as though she were uplifted by a flood of radiant ecstasy, by
a winged joy that carried her with it towards the sea yonder, towards
the bright rifts of the lightning-flashes, towards the distance of
futurity, eternity and everything that might happen&#8202;&hellip;. And
she let herself be borne along; and in that moment a certainty came
over her, penetrated deep down in her, like a divinely-implanted
conviction, that it would be as she had dreamed and hoped and wished,
that so it would happen, at long last, because life&rsquo;s chiefest
grace was at length descending upon her&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>Yes, it would happen like that: she knew it, she saw it in the
future. She saw herself living by his side, in his heart, in his arms;
living for herself and him; living for each other in all things; she
saw it shine out radiantly with each lightning-flash in the radiant
shining of those future years. She saw them, those children of the
past, with the dew upon them, smiling to each other as though they who,
as <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb311" href="#pb311" name=
"pb311">311</a>]</span>boy and girl, had unconsciously sought each
other had grown into a young man and a maiden who had found each other
&hellip; after the mystery of the cloud-veil and of the distant river
under the spreading leaves; and they now went on together: their paths
ran up towards the glittering cities of the future, which reared their
crystal domes under the revealing skies, while from out their riot of
towers sunbeams flashed and struck a thousand colours from the crystal
domes&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>A wind rose, as though waking in the very bed of the slumbering
night, and leapt to the sky. A cool breath drifted straight out of the
sultry, louring clouds; a few drops pattered upon the leaves. And the
wind carried the storm farther, carried the revelation with it; the
lightning flashed twice, thrice more &hellip; vanished &hellip; paled
away&#8202;&hellip;. Not until it had travelled far, very far, would
the wind let loose the clouds, would the night-rain fall &hellip; so
Constance thought, vaguely&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>And she sighed deeply, as though waking out of her languor of
ecstasy, now that the night, after that rising wind, was no longer so
sultry and oppressive. She stood up, wearily, closed the window, saw a
morning pallor already dawning through the trees&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>And she lay down and fell asleep: yes, that was what would happen,
it would be like that; she felt <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb312"
href="#pb312" name="pb312">312</a>]</span>certain of it: that future
would come; the paths ran to the crystal-domed city; she was going to
it with him &hellip; with him!&hellip;</p>
<p>Yes, it would come, it would come, to-morrow, yes,
to-morrow&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>And, while that hope still continued to transfigure her face, pale
on the pillow in the dawning day, her eyes, blind from long gazing at
the light, closed heavily; and she fell asleep, convinced &hellip;
convinced&#8202;&hellip;. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb313" href=

<p class="first">Conviction had conquered doubt and reigned triumphant.
When Constance awoke early that morning, she was full of proud, calm
confidence, as though she knew the future positively. She hesitated to
go to her husband in his room; and he seemed to avoid her too, for as
early as seven o&rsquo;clock she saw him, from her window, riding off
on his bicycle. Since their conversation, she had not seen him, did not
know what he thought; and it struck her that he was not dashing away,
as he had done so often lately, like a madman, but that he pedalled
along quietly, with a certain melancholy resignation in his face, which
she just saw flickering past under his bicycling-cap.</p>
<p>She listened to hear if Addie was awake, but he seemed to be still
asleep; also it was holiday-time. And she began to think of Van
Vreeswijck and made up her mind to write to him, just a line, to ask
him to come, a single line which however would at once allow him to
read, between the letters, that Marianne could not love
him&#8202;&hellip;. And, while thinking, with a tender pity for him
amid her own calm certainty, she bit her pen, looked out of the
window&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>The August morning was already sunny at that hour: there was a blue
sky with white, fleecy clouds, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb314"
href="#pb314" name="pb314">314</a>]</span>which passed like flocks of
snowy sheep through a blue meadow; the wind urged the sheep before it,
like an impetuous drover. And, while she searched for those difficult
words, her mind recalled the night before and the lightning yonder,
above the sea, which she divined in the distance&#8202;&hellip;. It was
strange, but now, in that morning light, with that placid sky at which
she gazed, thinking of Van Vreeswijck and how to tell him in a single,
merciful word&mdash;with that summer blue full of fleecy white, at
which she was gazing so fixedly after the ecstasy and winged bliss that
had uplifted her the night before&mdash;it was as if her calm, proud
confidence in her knowledge of the future was wavering&#8202;&hellip;.
She did not know why, for after all she thought that Henri would
consent to their divorcing&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>They would be divorced&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>And Marianne would&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>Suddenly, she began to write. She wrote more than she intended to
write: she now wrote the truth straight away, in an impulse of honesty,
and at the end of her letter she asked Van Vreeswijck to call on her
that evening.</p>
<p>She had just finished, when Addie came in. He kissed her and waited
until she had signed her letter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why aren&rsquo;t you bicycling with Papa?&rdquo; she asked.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb315" href="#pb315" name=
"pb315">315</a>]</span></p>
<p>He said that his father had asked him to speak to
her&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>And now, sitting beside her, with her hand in his, he told her,
without once mentioning Marianne&rsquo;s name, what Papa had said. His
calm, almost cold, business-like words sobered her completely, while
she continued pensively to look at the sky, which seemed now to be
wearing a blue smile of ignorance and indifference&#8202;&hellip;.
Suddenly it seemed to her as if she had been dreaming&#8202;&hellip;.
Not that her thoughts took any definite form, for first the ideal
vision whose realization had seemed so certain, then the morning doubts
and now the disenchantment of the sober facts had all followed too
swiftly upon one another; and she could not take it all in; she did not
know what she thought. It only seemed to her as if she had been
dreaming.</p>
<p>Automatically, she said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it is better so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had not expected it!</p>
<p>She had never thought that Henri&rsquo;s answer would be the one
which she now heard from the mouth of their son!</p>
<p>Did one ever know another person, though one lived with that person
for years? Did she know her son, did she know herself?</p>
<p>But the boy held her hand affectionately.</p>
<p>And he read the stupefaction in her eyes: <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb316" href="#pb316" name="pb316">316</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me, honestly, Mamma. Are you disappointed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was silent, gazed at the placid sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you rather have started a fresh life &hellip; away from
Papa?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She bowed her head, let it rest upon his shoulder:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Addie,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>She made an attempt to pick her words, but her honesty was once more
too strong for her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, simply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you would rather have had it so &hellip; for your own
sake?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would rather have had it so, yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had even pictured it &hellip; like that,&rdquo; she said,
presently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I speak to Papa again then, Mamma? If I tell him that
you had already been thinking of it&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You believe&#8202;&hellip;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will agree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it means the &ldquo;happiness of both of
you&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me what Papa said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t remember exactly&#8202;&hellip;. Only Papa
thought &hellip; that not to see me for six months at a time would be
more than he could bear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that all that Papa said?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb317" href=
"#pb317" name="pb317">317</a>]</span></p>
<p>But he gave just a smile of melancholy resignation; and his look
told that that was not all. She understood. She understood that they
had spoken of Marianne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So Papa&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo; she repeated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would rather stay with <i>us</i>, Mamma.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With us,&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;We three
together?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It means going on living &hellip; a lie,&rdquo; she said, in
a blank voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I will speak to Papa again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Addie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t do that. Don&rsquo;t ask Papa &hellip; to
think it over again. It is perhaps too late, after all; and besides
&hellip; Papa is right. About you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He could not go six months without you. And
I&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you, Mamma&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you could.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I couldn&rsquo;t either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She suddenly passed her hands along his face, along his shoulders,
his knees, as though she wished to feel him, to feel the reality
&hellip; the reality of her life. He &hellip; he was the real thing,
the truth; but all the rest between her husband and her was
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb318" href="#pb318" name=
"pb318">318</a>]</span>falsehood, remained falsehood &hellip; because
of people. Could they not even for Addie&rsquo;s sake purge that
falsehood into truth? No, no, not even for him. Would falsehood then
always cleave to them?&hellip;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are too small,&rdquo; she thought and murmured her thought
aloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing&#8202;&hellip;. Very well, Addie&#8202;&hellip;. Tell
Papa that it shall be as he says, that I am quite content &hellip; that
I could not do without you either &hellip; for six months!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked at him, looked into his serious blue eyes, as though she
had forgotten him and were now remembering him for the first time. Six
months &hellip; six months without him! The new life, the new paths,
the new cities, on those far-off, new horizons &hellip; and six months
&hellip; six months without Addie!&hellip;</p>
<p>Had she then been dreaming? Had she just been dazzled by that
glittering vision? Was it just intoxication, ecstasy? Was it just
glamour and enchantment?&hellip;</p>
<p>He left her. She dressed and went downstairs.</p>
<p>She felt as if she were back from a long journey and seeing her
house again after an absence of months. Her movements were almost like
those of a sleep-walker; the house seemed something remote and
impersonal, though she had always loved it, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb319" href="#pb319" name=
"pb319">319</a>]</span>looked after it, made it her beautiful home by a
thousand intimate touches. She now went through the house mechanically
performing her usual little housewifely duties, still half dreaming, in
a condition of semi-consciousness. It was as if her thoughts were
standing still, as if she no longer knew, nor for that matter thought,
remembering only the night before, that lonely evening of inward
conviction&#8202;&hellip;. The morning had dawned, placid, with its
cloudless sky; Addie had come: she now knew what Henri thought. It
surprised her just a little that Henri thought like that &hellip; and
then she realized that, after all, he did not love Marianne very much
&hellip; that he must love her less than Addie. Poor Marianne, she
thought; and she reflected that women love more absolutely than
men&#8202;&hellip;. She spoke to the servant, gave her orders, did all
the actual, everyday things, in between her thoughts. And suddenly she
looked deep down into herself, once more saw so completely into her own
clear depths that she was startled at herself and shuddered. She saw
that, if Henri had made the same proposal to her that she had made to
him, she would have accepted it in her desire for happiness, for
happiness with the man whom she loved and who&mdash;she felt
it!&mdash;loved her. She saw that she would have accepted and that she
would not have hesitated because of her son!&hellip; Her son! He was
certain to be leaving them soon in any case &hellip; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb320" href="#pb320" name="pb320">320</a>]</span>to
seek his own life!&hellip; Her son! To provide him for a few years more
with the paternal house, that wretched fabric of lies, which he, the
boy, alone kept together &hellip; for his sake and for the sake of that
joint falsehood, she would have to reject the new life of
truth!&hellip; It was as if she were standing in a maze; but she was
certain that she would not have hesitated in that maze, if the decision
had been left to her &hellip; that she would have known how to take the
path of simple honesty &hellip; that she would have elected to
separate, in spite of Addie &hellip; that she loved her new
life&mdash;and the stranger&mdash;more than her child!</p>
<p>She had learnt to know herself in that new atmosphere of pure truth;
and now &hellip; now she saw so far into those translucent depths that
she was frightened and shuddered as in the presence of something
monstrous; for it seemed monstrous to her to place anything above her
child, above the dear solace of so many years&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>Just then Van der Welcke came home; she heard him put away his
bicycle, go up the stairs &hellip; and then turn back, as if reflecting
that he could no longer avoid his wife. He entered, abruptly. She,
trembling, had sat down, because she felt on the verge of
falling&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has Addie told you?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, in a low voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And &hellip; you think it is the best thing?&hellip;&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb321" href="#pb321" name=
"pb321">321</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes &hellip; I do&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So everything remains&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo; he said,
hesitatingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As it was,&rdquo; she replied, almost inaudibly; and her
voice hesitated also.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He told you &hellip; the reason?&rdquo; he went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could not do without him &hellip; all the time that he
would be with you, Constance. And you couldn&rsquo;t do without the boy
either, could you, while he was with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said, automatically; and, as her voice failed
her, she repeated, more firmly, &ldquo;No, I should not be able to do
without him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that moment, she did not know if she was speaking the truth or
not. Only she had a vague sensation &hellip; as though that fair,
unsullied truth were retreating a little farther from her &hellip; like
a glittering cloud&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we might try to be more patient with each other,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;But still I should like to tell you, Constance, that I
appreciate your thought &hellip; your
intention&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, vaguely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your thought for me&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But she now found it impossible to let that retreating truth slip
still farther from her; and she said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was thinking of myself also, Henri &hellip; but
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb322" href="#pb322" name=
"pb322">322</a>]</span>it was not clear to me what I
thought&#8202;&hellip;. I don&rsquo;t quite know&#8202;&hellip;. Henri,
it is better like this, for everything to remain &hellip; as it
was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we both of us love our boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, both of us&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He saw her turn very pale as she leant back in her chair, her arms
hanging limply beside her. He had a sudden impulse to say something
kind, to give her a kiss; but at the same time he was conscious that
neither his words nor his caress would reach her. And he thought, what
was the good of it? They had no love for each other. They would remain
strangers, in spite of all that they had felt for each other during
these days: she suggesting for his happiness something dead against
convention; he thrilling with genuine gratitude&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that is settled then,&rdquo; was all that he said in
conclusion, quietly; and he went out, gently closing the door behind
him.</p>
<p>She did not move, but sat there, gazing dully into space. Yes, she
had counted her son a lesser thing than her new life! That was the
simple truth, just as much as the new life itself&#8202;&hellip;. And
now &hellip; now, as though her mind were wandering, she saw that new
life like a crystal city around her, threatening to crack, to rend
asunder, to be shattered in one mighty spasm of despair. Her eyes began
to burn from staring into those distant, cruel thoughts. In her breast
she felt a physical pain. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb323" href=
"#pb323" name="pb323">323</a>]</span>The house, the room stifled her.
She felt impelled to fly from that house, from the narrow circles,
which whirled giddily around her, to fly from herself. She was so much
perplexed in her own being, no longer knowing what was right, what was
honest, what true &hellip; that she yearned for space and air. Her
breast was wrung with grief and that gasping for breath. Still, she
controlled herself, took up a hat, pinned it on and found the strength
to say to the servant:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Truitje, I am going out&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was outside now, in the road. She had become afraid of the
loneliness of her room and of herself, a loneliness which in other ways
had become so dear to her. Now she was seeking something more than
spaciousness of air and forest; but the road, in which a few people
were walking, made her keep herself under control. She turned down a
side-path, went through the Woods. Here again there were people taking
their morning stroll&#8202;&hellip;. Suddenly, she gave a violent
start: she saw Brauws, sitting on a bench. She felt as if she would
faint; and, without knowing what she was doing, she turned round and
walked back&#8202;&hellip;. By this time, she had lost all her
self-command. He had seen her, however, and his hand had already gone
up to his hat. Suddenly, she heard his step behind her; he came up with
her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this how you run away from your friends?&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb324" href="#pb324" name=
"pb324">324</a>]</span>he said, making an attempt to joke, but in
obvious astonishment.</p>
<p>She looked at him; and he was struck with her confusion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be angry,&rdquo; she said, frankly, &ldquo;but I
was startled at seeing you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was not welcome,&rdquo; he said, roughly. &ldquo;Forgive
me, mevrouw. I ought not to have come after you. But I&rsquo;m a
tactless beggar in these matters. I am not one of your
society-men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be angry,&rdquo; she repeated, almost
entreatingly. &ldquo;Society indeed! I certainly showed myself no
society-woman &hellip; to &hellip; unexpectedly
to&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did not know what she wanted to say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To turn your back on me,&rdquo; he said, completing the
sentence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To turn my back on you,&rdquo; she repeated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, now that I have said
good-morning&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He lifted his hat, moved as though to go back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay!&rdquo; she entreated. &ldquo;Walk a little way with me.
Now that I happen to have met you&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I came back yesterday &hellip; I meant to call on you to-day
or to-morrow&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Walk with me,&rdquo; she said, almost entreatingly. &ldquo;I
want to speak to you&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suggested to Henri&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She drew a deep breath; there were people passing. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb325" href="#pb325" name="pb325">325</a>]</span>They
were near the Ponds. She ceased speaking; and they walked on
silently&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suggested to Henri,&rdquo; she repeated, at last,
&ldquo;that we should&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The word died away on her lips, but he understood. They were both
silent, both walked on without speaking. He led the way; and it seemed
to her that they were making for a goal, she knew not where, which he
would know&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>At last, she said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wanted &hellip; as you are our friend &hellip; to tell
you&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was determined to make her say the word:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You suggested what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That we should be divorced&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They walked on for some minutes. Suddenly, round about her, she saw
the dunes, the distant sea, the sea which she had divined the night
before, over which the pale gleams, the lightning-flashes had revealed
themselves. Now, the sky overhead was revealed, a vague opal, with
white clouds curling like steam&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suggested that we should be divorced,&rdquo; she
repeated.</p>
<p>He drew a breath, in the salt breath of the sea, even as he had
breathed in the Alps, when contemplating those ice-bound horizons. And
he remembered &hellip; that vision &hellip; and the yearning &hellip;
for the one soul &hellip; the meeting with which would <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb326" href="#pb326" name="pb326">326</a>]</span>have
been a consolation amid the constant disappointment encountered with
the many souls, the thousands&#8202;&hellip;. And a swift, keen hope
seemed to flash before him &hellip; not only of having found at last
&hellip; in silence &hellip; but of venturing to utter it &hellip;
once; and so keen, so dazzling was the hope that at first he did not
hear her say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Henri &hellip; thinks it is better &hellip;
not&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; he asked, as though deaf, as though blind.</p>
<p>She repeated:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Henri thinks it is better not&#8202;&hellip;. Because of our
boy &hellip; of Addie&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The keen hope had flashed for only a second, swiftly, with its
dizzying rays&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>Uttered it would never be&#8202;&hellip;. To have found in silence:
alas, that was all illusion &hellip; a dream &hellip; when one is very
young&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is right,&rdquo; he said, in a low voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he right?&rdquo; she asked, sadly. And, more firmly, she
repeated, &ldquo;Yes, he is right&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should have been sorry &hellip; for Addie&rsquo;s
sake,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she repeated, as though in a trance. &ldquo;I
should have been sorry for Addie&rsquo;s sake. But I had thought that I
should be able to live at last&mdash;my God, at last!&mdash;in absolute
truth and sincerity&#8202;&hellip;. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb327" href="#pb327" name="pb327">327</a>]</span>and not in a narrow
ring of convention, not in terror of people and what they may think
absurd and cannot understand &hellip; and &hellip;
and&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And&#8202;&hellip;?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And &hellip; in that thought, in that hope &hellip; I had
forgotten my boy. And yet he is the reality!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet he &hellip; is the reality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now I am sacrificing &hellip; the dream &hellip; the
illusion &hellip; to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes &hellip; the dream &hellip; the illusion,&rdquo; he said,
with a smile that was full of pain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It hurts me!&rdquo; she confessed, with a sob.
&ldquo;Yesterday&mdash;oh, only yesterday, last night!&mdash;I thought
that the dream, the illusion &hellip; was truth&#8202;&hellip;. But
what for young people can be a dream, an illusion &hellip; which comes
true&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is at our age&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Absurd?&rdquo; she asked, still wavering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not absurd perhaps &hellip; but impossible. We go bent under
too heavy a burden of the past to permit ourselves youthful dreams and
illusions. We no longer have any right &hellip; even to
memories&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have some &hellip; from my childhood,&rdquo; she stammered,
vaguely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are no memories left for us,&rdquo; he said, gently,
with his smile that was full of pain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, there are none left for us,&rdquo; she repeated.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb328" href="#pb328" name=
"pb328">328</a>]</span>And she confessed, &ldquo;I have dreamed
&hellip; and thought &hellip; too late. I &hellip; I have begun to live
too late&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I thought &hellip; that I had
lived; but I have done nothing &hellip; but
seek&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You never found?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps &hellip; almost. But, when I had found &hellip; I was
not allowed to put out my hand&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because &hellip; of the past?&rdquo; she asked, softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And of the present. Because of what <i>is</i> and has
younger, fresher rights than mine &hellip; which are no rights &hellip;
but the forbidden illusions of an old man&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not old&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Older every day. He alone is in the prime of life &hellip;
who has found &hellip; or thinks that he has
found&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that is so,&rdquo; she said; and her voice sounded like
a wail. &ldquo;I have begun to live too late. I could have lived
&hellip; even now &hellip; perhaps; but it is all too late. I once told
you &hellip; that I was abdicating my youth&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once, months ago&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since then, I have thought, dreamt, lived too much &hellip;
not to feel young &hellip; for a few moments&#8202;&hellip;. But it was
all an illusion &hellip; and it is all too
late&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They looked at each other. He bowed his head, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb329" href="#pb329" name="pb329">329</a>]</span>in
gentle acquiescence, with his smile that was full of pain:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is so,&rdquo; he said; and it was almost as if he
were joking. &ldquo;Come, let us be strong. I shall go on seeking
&hellip; and you&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I have my boy!&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;He has
<i>always</i> comforted me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They walked back slowly and took leave of each other at the door, a
friends&rsquo; leave-taking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you come again soon?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You know, you no
sooner see me than I am gone&#8202;&hellip;. I may go to England in the
autumn, to lecture on Peace. The world is full of mighty problems; and
we &hellip; we are pigmies &hellip; in the tiny worlds of our own
selves&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes &hellip; we are nothing&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He left her; she was conscious of a sort of farewell in the pressure
of his hand. She went in, with her head swimming; and her son was
there. And she embraced him, as though asking his forgiveness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Addie,&rdquo; she said, softly, &ldquo;Papa was right, Papa
was right&#8202;&hellip;. I believe that I now know for certain, dear,
that I know for certain that Papa was right&#8202;&hellip;. Oh, Addie,
whatever I may lose &hellip; you will not let me lose
you?&hellip;&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb330" href="#pb330"

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Had it all been an illusion then? Was it all for
nothing?</p>
<p>The days passed slowly, one after the other. She saw Van Vreeswijck
and felt for him, their friend, in his silent grief; she bade good-bye
to Bertha and her children. She knew that Van der Welcke had seen
Marianne once more before her departure; and her heart was full of pity
for them both.</p>
<p>Had it all been an illusion then, this world of feeling, this little
world of her own self? Oh, he was going to England, to lecture on
Peace; for him there were always those mighty problems which consoled
him for the smallness of that little world of self! But she, had she
lost everything, now that the illusion no longer shone before her, now
that the magic cities had fallen to pieces, now that everything had
become very dreary in the disenchantment and self-reproach of realizing
that she had not loved her son enough, that she had not loved him as
well as his father loved him, not as well as she had loved the
stranger, the friend who had taught her to live?&hellip;</p>
<p>Had she lost everything then? Now, ah now, she was really old,
grey-haired; now her eye was no longer bright, her step no longer
brisk; now it was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb331" href="#pb331"
name="pb331">331</a>]</span>really all over and it was over
forever&#8202;&hellip;. But had she lost everything then? This was what
she often asked herself in the days that followed, those days of
sadness, sadness for herself, for him, for her son, for her husband,
for the girl whom she loved too &hellip; for all those people, for all
her life&#8202;&hellip;. And what of the great questions, the mighty
problems of life? Ah, they no longer stood out before her, now that he
who had called her attention to them had gone straight towards those
mighty problems as to the towers of the greater life! To her they
seemed infinitely remote, shadowy cities on a far horizon behind her
own shattered cities of fair translucent hopes&#8202;&hellip;. Had she
then lost her interest in all those things? And, having lost that
interest, did she no longer care for her own development, for books,
nature, art? Was the life that she had been living all illusion, a
dream-life of love, lived under his influence, lived under his
compelling eyes?</p>
<p>Yes, that was how it had been, that was how she would have to
acknowledge it to herself!&hellip; That was how it was!&hellip; That
was how it was!&hellip; Only with his eyes upon her had she felt
herself born again &hellip; born again from her childhood onwards
&hellip; until she had once more conjured up the fairy-vision of the
little girl with the red flowers on her temples who ran over the
boulders in the river under the spreading tropical leaves, beckoning
the wondering little brothers&#8202;&hellip;. And she, a middle-aged
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb332" href="#pb332" name=
"pb332">332</a>]</span>woman, had grown into a girl who dreamed the
shimmering dreams that were wafted along rainbow paths towards the
distant clouds high in the heavens&#8202;&hellip;. In her maturity, she
had developed herself hurriedly, as though afraid of being too late,
into a thinking, feeling, loving woman&#8202;&hellip;. She had been
sincere in that new, hurried life; but it had been nothing more than
illusion and illusion alone, the illusion of a woman who felt herself
growing old without ever, ever having lived&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>But, though it had all been illusion, was illusion nothing
then?&hellip; Or was illusion indeed something, something of no great
account? And, even though she had lived only illusion, illusion under
the compelling eyes of the man whom she loved, feeling love for the
first and only time, under the brooding, anguished eyes of that thinker
and seeker, had she not lived then, had she not lived then?</p>
<p>Yes, she had: she had lived, in the way in which a woman like
herself&mdash;a woman who had never felt simply and sincerely except as
a child in those far-off childish days, a woman whose life had been
nothing but artificiality and failure&mdash;could live again, only
later still, older still, old almost and finished; she had lived in
illusions, in a fleeting illusion, which just for one moment she had
tried to grasp, that day, now a few months ago&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>She shook her head, her grey head; she was no <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb333" href="#pb333" name=
"pb333">333</a>]</span>longer blinded; she saw: she saw that it could
never have been&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>Yet she felt that they had&mdash;both of them&mdash;lived the
illusion&mdash;both of them&mdash;for a little
while&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>And was nothing left of it?</p>
<p>Now that the long dreary days of sadness were drawing on, she saw:
she saw that there was indeed something left, that a ray of light
remained in her small soul, which had only been able to live like that,
very late; for she saw that, in spite of all her repining, there was
still gratitude&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>Yes, she was grateful, for she had lived, even though everything had
been illusion, the late blossoming of ephemeral
dream-flowers&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>And now&mdash;when she felt that strange question rise in her soul:
is this life, this futile, endless round, or is there &hellip; is there
anything else? When she felt that bewildering, passionate
doubt&mdash;then she was conscious, deep down in her heart, with a
throb of gratitude, that there was something else&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>Illusion, yes, only illusion, without which there is no
life&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
